dlga_start:fighter_talk|Merhabalar. Burada biraz talim yapıp dövüş yeteneklerimizi geliştiriyoruz. Sen de dövüş talimi yapmak istersen bize katılabilirsin. Herhangi bir dövüş tekniğinin açıklamasına ihtiyaç duyarsan, birimize sor, elimizden geldiğince anlatmaya çalışırız.
dlga_start:fighter_talk.1|Neyi talim etmek istersin?
dlga_fighter_pretalk:fighter_talk|Hangi talimi yapmak istersin?
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_attack|Saldırı talimi yapmak istiyorum.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_parry|Silahımla savunma yapmayı öğrenmek istiyorum.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_combat|Dövüş talimi yapmak istiyorum.
dlga_fighter_talk:close_window|[Ayrıl]
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack:fighter_talk_train_attack_2|Pekala. Dört değişik saldırı yönü vardır. Bunlar yukarıdan saldırı, sağdan saldırı, soldan saldırı ve saplama hamlesidir. Bu talimde sana hangi çeşit saldırı yapmanı istediğimi söyleyeceğim, sen de dediğim saldırıyı yapmalısın.  ^^( Saldırı yönünü belirlemek için sol tuşa basarken fareyi hareket ettirin. Örneğin yukarıdan saldırmak için fareyi yukarıya hareket ettirirken sol tuşa basın.  Ekranda görünen ikonlar size yapmanız gereken hareketi gösterecektir.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:close_window|Başlayalım öyleyse. Ben hazırım.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:fighter_pretalk|Aslında başka bir şey yapmak istiyorum.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry:fighter_talk_train_parry_2|Kalkan her yönden gelen saldırıyı savuşturur. Ama kılıç ya da başka bir silahla blok yapıyorsan, yalnızca blok yaptığın yönden gelen saldırıları durdurabilirsin. Mesela  yukarı blok yapıyorsan sadece yukarıdan aşağıya savrulmuş darbeleri durdurabilirsin, ama rakibin başka çeşit bir saldırı yapıyorsa blokun işe yaramaz.^^(Blok yapmak için farenin sağ tuşuna basılı tutun.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_2:fighter_talk_train_parry_3|Şimdi sana farklı saldırı çeşitleriyle geleceğim ama silahımla sana vurmadan önce doğru blok hareketini yapmanı bekleyeceğim. Sen de mümkün olduğunca çabuk doğru bloku yapmaya çalış. (Bu egzersiz otomatik blok yönü seçme seçeneğiyle çok kolaydır.  Eğer seçeneklere gidip blok yönü seçimini 'fare ile' veya 'klavye ile' yaparsanız doğru blok yönünü kendiniz seçmek zorunda kalırsınız. Bu çok daha zor olmakla birlikte oyunu da çok daha eğlenceli hale getirir. Bu durumda bloklamayı öğrenmeniz için bu egzersiz çok faydalı olacaktır.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:close_window|Başlayalım öyleyse. Ben hazırım.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:fighter_pretalk|Aslında başka bir şey yapmak istiyorum.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat:fighter_talk_train_combat_2|Dövüş talimi gerçek muharebeye hazırlık için mükemmel bir yoldur. Şimdi ölümcül zarar vermeyen tahta silahlarla ikimizden biri yere düşene kadar dövüşeceğiz. Biraz yara bere içinde kalabilirsin ama gerçek savaşta ikiye kesileceğine dersini burada alman daha iyi.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:close_window|Başlayalım öyleyse. Ben hazırım.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:fighter_pretalk|Aslında başka bir şey yapmak istiyorum.
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again|Güzel. Saldırılarımı gayet iyi savuşturdun. İstersen bu talimi tekrarlayabiliriz, sen de doğru blokları daha hızlı yapmaya çalışırsın. Tekrar denemek ister misin?
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again.1|Pekala, sanırım pek iyi gitmedi. (Unutma, bloklamayı doğru bir şekilde yapmak için fareyi hareket ettirirken sağ fare tuşuna basılı tutmalısın.) Tekrar denemek ister misin?
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_train_parry|Evet. Tekrar deneyelim.
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_parry|Hayır, sanırım şimdilik bu kadar yeter.
dlga_start:fighter_parry_warn|Hey! Saldırı engellemeyi çalışıyoruz dostum. Saldırılarımı engellemen gerek, sense bana geri saldırıyorsun.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_train_parry|Özür dilerim – tekrar deneyelim.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_leave_parry|Üzgünüm. Talimi yarıda bırakmam gerek.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_parry:close_window|Tamamdır. Nasıl istersen
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again|Pekala, sanırım pek iyi gitmedi. Ama azmini yitirme. Aynı hatayı da bir daha yapmamaya çalış. Tekrar denemek ister misin?
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_train_combat|Evet. Tekrar deneyelim.
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_combat|Hayır, sanırım şimdilik bu kadar yeter.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_combat:close_window|Pekala, sen bilirsin. Fikrini değiştirirsen yanıma gel.
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again.1|İyi dövüş oldu. Beni bu sefer yendin ama sonraki sefere galip ben olacağım. Ne dersin, bir daha dövüşelim mi?
dlga_start:fighter_talk.2|Güzel. Sana söylediğim yönden saldırmayı becerdin. İstersen bu talimi tekrarlayabilir ya da başka bir talime geçebiliriz.
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2|Fena değil. Okçuluğun temel kaidelerini anlamış gibisin. Bu sefer aynı talimi kundaklı yayla yapmaya çalış. Kundaklı yayı kullanması ok yaya göre daha kolaydır ama her atıştan sonra yeni ok koyup kurman gerekir.
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2.1|İyi. Kundaklı yayı kullanmakta da fazla zorlanmadın. Şimdi de fırlatmayı öğreneceksin. Şurada gördüğün cidarları alıp arkadaki üç hedefi vurmaya çalış. 
dlga_start:ranged_end|Evet, böylece üç uzak mesafe silah çeşidini kullanmayı da öğrenmiş oldun. Bundan sonrası sana kalmış. Her gün düzenli talim yaparsan zamanla Kalradya'nın en iyi nişancıları kadar iyi bir atıcı olursun.
dlga_ranged_end:close_window|Şimdi gidip dövüşçülerle ya da binicilerle çalışabilirsin. Onlardan da öğreneceğin çok şeyler var.
dlga_start:archer_talk|Merhaba, genç adam. Ben şuradakilerin okçuluk ustasıyım. Günlerimi bu talim alanında isteyen gençlere okçuluğu öğreterek geçiriyorum. Eğer senin de bir ustaya ihtiyacın varsa, sana da yay, kundaklı yay ve cida atmanın temel kaidelerini öğretirim.
dlga_archer_talk:archer_challenge|Evet, ustam. Bana bu silahları kullanmayı göster.
dlga_archer_talk:close_window|İstemem. Sağol.
dlga_archer_challenge:archer_challenge_2|Pekala. İlk önce ok atmayı göstereceğim. Ok yayı kullanmak hüner ister. Ama bir kez öğrendin mi süratli ve güçlü şekilde ok atıp düşmanlarını perişan edebilirsin. Şimdi gidip şurada gördüğün yay ve okları al. Sonra da nişan alıp şu arkamdaki hedefleri vur.
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window|Tamam. Hazırım.
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window.1|Az izin ver. Önce başka bir şey yapmam lazım.
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2|Umarım at binmekten hoşlanmışsındır. Şimdi daha zor bir işe geçelim. Şurada gördüğün kargıyı alıp koşu alanının yanındaki hedeflerin her birine birer kez vur.
; dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2.1|Good! You have been able to hit all targets on horseback. That's no easy feat for a starter. Your next challenge will be using a bow and arrows to shoot at the archery targets by the road. You need to put an arrow to each target to consider yourself successful.
dlga_start:horsemanship_end|Çok iyi. Ok ve yayla tüm hedefleri vurdun. Bundan sonra her gün binicilik ve savaş talimlerini yapmaya devam et ki kısa zamanda usta bir süvari olasın.
dlga_horsemanship_end:close_window|Şimdi gidip dövüşçülerle ya da okçuluk ustasıyla çalışabilirsin. Zamanı geldiğinde kendini savunmak için mümkün olduğunca çok şey öğrenmelisin.
dlga_start:horseman_talk|İyi günler. Buraya at binmeye gelmiştim ama sırtımın ağrısı bana bana bugün aman vermeyecek. Eğer istersen atımı alıp biraz binicilik çalışabilirsin. Hem ata da talim olmuş olur.
dlga_horseman_talk:horseman_challenge|Evet, ustam. At binmeyi çok isterim.
dlga_horseman_talk:close_window|Sağol, ustam. Belki sonra.
dlga_horseman_challenge:horseman_melee_challenge_2|Güzel. Şimdi sana biniciliği ve at sırtında silah kullanmayı öğretecek birkaç talim vereceğim. İlk görevin ata binip alanın etrafında en az bir tur gitmek. İstediğin yerde hızlı istediğin yerde yavaş git. Ata alışmaya çalış ki bundan sonraki daha zor talimlere hazır olasın.
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window|Tamam. Hazırım.
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window.1|Biraz bekle. Önce yapmam gereken bir şey var.
dlga_tutorial_troop_default:close_window|Hey, burada nişan almaya çalışıyorum. Eğer okçuluk öğrenmek istiyorsan şuradaki ustamızla konuş.
dlga_start:lord_prison_break_confirm_3|Planlarda bir değişiklik mi var?
dlga_start:lord_prison_break|Neler oluyor?
dlga_start:drunk_response|Neye bakıyorsun sen?
dlga_start:drunk_response.1|Bana mı bakıyorsun?
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window|Ne büyük kayıp...
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window.1|Ben olacağıma o olsun...
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start|Emin değilim... Bir çeşit hayvan olsa gerek.
dlga_drunk_response:dplmc_drunk_attempt_placate|Özür dilerim – Lütfen özrümü kabul edin.
dlga_dplmc_drunk_attempt_placate:close_window|Yeteri kadar düşündüm. Hemen git buradan.
dlga_dplmc_drunk_attempt_placate:close_window.1|Suratındaki pis sırıtışı temizleyeceğim şimdi!
dlga_drunk_fight_start:close_window|Suratındaki pis sırıtışı temizleyeceğim şimdi!
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_player_high_renown|Sen benim kim olduğumu biliyor musun?
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start|Umrumda mı?
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start.1|Küçük bir bücür için büyük konuşuyorsun. Sana gününü göstereceğim!
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_player_high_renown|Şey... Aslında... Evet,evet, sizin kim olduğunuzu biliyorum, {s0}. Lütfen beni affedin, haşmeetlim. İçki yüzünden olmalı. Şimdi gidiyorum...
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start.2|Neden, dövüş mü istiyorsun? Haydi o zaman !
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:close_window|Yeteri kadar düşündüm. Hemen git buradan.
dlga_start:fistfight_response|Birkaç zorlukla başa çıkabilecek bir {adama/kadına} benziyorsun. Sana bir iş teklifim var.
dlga_fistfight_response:fistfight_response_2|Ne dersin?
dlga_fistfight_response_2:fistfight_response_2a|Güzel – İlgilenmene sevindim. Plan şu ... Biraz karmaşık gelebilir, bu yüzden iyi dinle.
dlga_fistfight_response_2a:fistfight_response_3|Sen ve diğer adam burada bir kavga başlatacaksınız. Silah ve zırh olmayacak – Ben de arkama yaslanıp bahisleri toplayacağım ve kârı kazananla paylaşacağım. Eğer kaybedersek, zararı ben karşılayacağım. Yani kaybedecek bir şeyin yok, biraz kandan başka.
dlga_fistfight_response_3:fistfight_response_4|Ne var ki, şu herkesin önceden bahis yatırdığı hoş arena dövüşlerinden tertipleyemiyoruz. İnsanlar ilk önce içeri girer, sonra havaya kapılıp hanginizin yeneceğini düşünüyorsa üzerine birkaç dinar yatırır. Onlarla iddiaya bile gireceğim. Yoksa 3. bira şişesini götüren bir adamın hiç iddiaya girmemiş olması kuşku uyandırır.
dlga_fistfight_response_4:fistfight_response_4a|Yani anlayacağın, bütün hile, insanlar rakibinin üzerine bahis oynayana kadar kendini yeniliyormuş gibi göstermek -- daha sonra hızlı bir atak yap ve bahisler senin üzerine oynanmadan kavgayı kazan. Senin için para kazanmanın en kolay yolu neredeyse yere yapışacak kadar tartaklanmak ve aniden ayağa kalkıp diğer adamı indirmek. Yine de, kavganın sonunda ikimizin de para kazanması için yenmek zorundasın.
dlga_fistfight_response_4a:fistfight_response_5|Ayrıca, kavgayı çok fazla uzatma. Yoksa insanlar şike yaptığından şüphelenmeye başlar. Bu yüzden birinizin sürekli yumruk yemesi gerekiyor. Kimin kanının döküldüğü pek umurumda değil ama kan dökülmeli.
dlga_fistfight_response_5:fistfight_response_5a|Ve bir şey daha -- Benim ortağım, senin rakibin, ustaca hareketler yapmakta çok iyi değil. Bu yüzden o sadece senin üzerine doğru yürüyecek. Yani işin bu kısmı da sana kalıyor.
dlga_fistfight_response_5a:fistfight_response_confirm|Peki ne düşünüyorsun?
dlga_fistfight_response_confirm:close_window.1|Yapacak daha önemli işlerim var.
dlga_start:ramun_introduce_1|İyi günler, genç {adam/hanım}.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:ramun_introduce_2|Affedersin, bir tüccara benziyorsun, ama mallarını göremiyorum?
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:close_window|Boşversene.
dlga_ramun_introduce_2:ramun_introduce_3|Tüccar mı? Ah, evet, kesinlikle öyleyim. Ama benim mallarım çoğundan farklı. Günde iki kere suyunun verilmesi ve beslenmesi gerekiyor ayrıca arkamı döner dönmez kaçmaya yelteniyor.
dlga_ramun_introduce_3:ramun_introduce_4|Çiftlik hayvanları mı?
dlga_ramun_introduce_4:ramun_introduce_5|Eh, bir bakıma. Kendime bu okyanustaki her gemiyi hareket ettiren adam demeyi tercih ediyorum. Gemiler küreklerle hareket eder, kürekler de adamlar sayesinde hareket eder, yoksa oldukları yerde boş boş dururlar. İşte ben tam olarak burada devreye giriyorum.
dlga_ramun_introduce_5:ramun_introduce_6|Kürek mahkumları.
dlga_ramun_introduce_6:ramun_introduce_7|Şimdi çakmaya başladın! Böyle bir ticaret limanı onlarsız yaşayamaz. Gemiler her yolculukta bir avuç dolusunu kaybediyor, dolayısıyla her zaman yüksek talep var. Kaptanlar bana geliyorlar ve iyi ödüyorlar.
; dlga_ramun_introduce_7:ramun_introduce_8|Where do the slaves come from?
; dlga_ramun_introduce_8:ramun_introduce_9|Mostly I deal in convicted criminals bought from the authorities. Others are prisoners of war from various nations, brought to me because I offer the best prices. However, on occasion I'll buy from privateers and other . . . 'individuals'. You can't be picky about your suppliers in this line of work. You wouldn't happen to have any prisoners with you, would you?
; dlga_ramun_introduce_9:ramun_introduce_10|Me? 
; dlga_ramun_introduce_10:ramun_introduce_11|Why not? If you intend to set foot outside this town, you're going to cross swords with someone sooner or later. And, God willing, you'll come out on top. Why not make some extra money off the whole thing? Take them alive, bring them back to me, and I'll pay you fifty coins for each head. Don't much care who they are or where they come from.
; dlga_ramun_introduce_11:ramun_introduce_12|Hmm. I'll think about it.
; dlga_ramun_introduce_12:close_window|Do think about it! There's a lot of silver to be made, no mistake. More than enough for the both of us.
; dlga_start:ramun_talk|Hello, {playername}.
; dlga_ramun_pre_talk:ramun_talk|Anything else?
; dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners|I've brought you some prisoners, Ramun. Would you like a look?
; dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners_all|I want to sell all the prisoners I have with me.
; dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all:ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2|I'll take your {reg0} {reg2?prisoners:prisoner} off your hands for {reg1} coins.  We have a deal?
; dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|We have a deal.
; dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2:ramun_pre_talk|Let me think about it again.
; dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Let me see what you have...
; dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|A pleasure doing business with you.
; dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing|How do I take somebody as prisoner?
; dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing.1|Can you tell me again about capturing prisoners?
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_have_blunt_weapon|You're new to this, aren't you? Let me explain it in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? I'm assuming you have a blunt weapon with you . . .
; dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Of course.
; dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no|As a matter of fact, I don't.
; dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Good. Then all you need to do is beat the bugger down with your weapon, and when the fighting's over you clap him in irons. It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp. I don't have many requirements in my merchandise, but I do insist they be breathing when I buy them.
; dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2|No? Heh, well, this must be your lucky day. I've got an old club lying around that I was going to throw away. It a bit battered, but still good enough bash someone until he stops moving. Here, have it.
; dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Thanks, Ramun. Perhaps I may try my hand at it.
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Alright, I'll try and expain it again in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp.
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_2:ramun_ask_about_capturing_3|Alright, I think I understand. Anything else?
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_3:ramun_ask_about_capturing_4|Well, it's not as simple as all that. Blunt weapons don't do as much damage as sharp ones, so they won't bring your enemies down as quickly. And trust me, given the chance, most of the scum you run across would just as soon kill you as look at you, so don't expect any courtesy when you pull out a club instead of a sword. Moreover, having to drag prisoners to and fro will slow down your party, which is why some people simply set their prisoners free after the fighting's done. It's madness. How could anyone turn down all that silver, eh?
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_4:ramun_ask_about_capturing_5|Is that everything?
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_5:ramun_ask_about_capturing_7|Just one final thing. Managing prisoners safely is not an easy thing to do, you could call it a skill in itself. If you want to capture a lot of prisoners, you should try and learn the tricks of it yourself, or you won't be able to hang on to a single man you catch.
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_7:ramun_pre_talk|Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
; dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_leave|I'd better be going.
; dlga_ramun_leave:close_window|Remember, any prisoners you've got, bring them to me. I'll pay you good silver for every one.
; dlga_start:close_window.5|I humbly request that your {lordship/ladyship} keeps {his/her} hands where I can see them.
; dlga_start:manhunter_talk_b|Hey, you there! You seen any outlaws around here?
; dlga_manhunter_talk_b:manhunter_talk_b1|Yes, they went this way about an hour ago.
; dlga_manhunter_talk_b1:close_window|I knew it! Come on, lads, lets go get these bastards! Thanks a lot, friend.
; dlga_manhunter_talk_b:manhunter_talk_b2|No, haven't seen any outlaws lately.
; dlga_manhunter_talk_b2:close_window|Bah. They're holed up in this country like rats, but we'll smoke them out yet. Sooner or later.
; dlga_looters_1:looters_2|{s4}
; dlga_looters_2:close_window|I'm not afraid of you lot. Fight me if you dare!
; dlga_looters_2:close_window.1|You'll have nothing of mine but cold steel, scum.
; dlga_start:smugglers_intro_1|Good day to you.
; dlga_smugglers_intro_1:smugglers_intro_2|I hear you've been causing trouble at {s1}. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you all.
; dlga_smugglers_intro_2:smugglers_intro_3|We hid out at {s1}, yes, but only because we needed a place to stay. And perhaps we did not behave in a proper manner. We were driven out of {s6} by the town watch, in one of their periodic purges, and we were just lying low until things slowed down again. We are heading back there now, and we'll never trouble the villagers of {s1} again. If you let us go, we will give you a bottle of the finest Arbor wine, which the merchants divert to the well-born, and which you'll never see at a merchant's shop or tavern.

; dlga_merchant_quest_4_start:close_window|It's time, lads! Up and at them!
; dlga_start:relative_saved_1a|Thank you! Thank you, {my lord/my lady}, for rescuing me from those fiends. Did my brother in {s9} put you onto their track?
; dlga_relative_saved_1a:close_window|Yes. I told him that I would find you. I advise you to return to your family as quickly as you can -- and be careful on the road.
; dlga_start:bandit_leader_1a|Ay! Spare me! Spare my life! Let me go, and I'll go far away from here, and learn an honest trade, and you'll never hear of me again!
; dlga_bandit_leader_1a:bandit_leader_1b|I'll spare your life -- but in exchange, I want information. Either you or your mates kidnapped the brother of a prominent merchant in town.

; dlga_start:looter_leader_1|What do you want?
; dlga_looter_leader_1:looter_leader_2|I've been looking for you. Tell me where you keep your prisoners, and I'll let you go.

; dlga_looter_leader_2:looter_leader_3|Hah! Those prisoners are only going free if you pay their ransom. Did you bring any silver?
; dlga_looter_leader_3:close_window|No, but I brought steel.
; dlga_bandit_leader_1b:close_window|Oh bless you, {my lord/my lady}. May the Seven bless you! We've done the lad no harm. We've been keeping him in our hideout near Storm's End. I'll describe the area nearby in detail, so there's no mistaking it...
; dlga_start:rescue_prisoner_succeed_2|{playername}, you saved {reg4?her:him}! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.
; dlga_rescue_prisoner_succeed_2:lord_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.
; dlga_start_up_quest_1_next:close_window|Are you all right? Well.... I guess you're alive, at any rate. I'm not sure that we can say the same for the other fellow. That's one less thief to trouble our streets at night, although the Father knows he won't be the last.... Anyway, let's talk more inside, there's a chill to the air I'd rather be without.
; dlga_start:merchant_quest_2a|Splendid work. You have hired enough men to take on the bandits. Now -- travellers entering {s9} have told us that there is a small group of robbers lurking on the outside of town. I suspect that they are all from the same band, the one that took my brother. Hunt them down and defeat them, and make them disclose the location of their lair!
; dlga_start:merchant_quest_3a|So, you've found out where they hid my brother? Splendid work. I flatter myself that I'm a fine judge of character, and you look to be a {man/woman} who can get things done. Now, go out and save his unworthy hide!
; dlga_start:merchant_quest_3b|Well... My brother is home safe. I'm not sure what to do with him -- maybe pack him off to Oldtown, or have him join the brothers on the Quiet Isle. That way, if he gets knocked on the head in a street brawl, no one can say it's my fault. But that's not your problem. Here's the rest of your reward. It was well-earned.
; dlga_merchant_quest_3b:merchant_quest_4a|The money is most welcome, and I am glad to have been of service
; dlga_merchant_quest_4a:merchant_quest_4b|Good! Now... Are you interested in making some more?
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b:merchant_quest_4b1|Possibly. What do you need?
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b1:merchant_quest_4b2|Remember how I told you that the bandits had an ally inside the walls? I think I know who it is -- the captain of the watch, no less. Some months ago this captain, seeing the amount of profit we merchants were making from trade across the frontiers, decided to borrow some money to sponsor a caravan. Unfortunately, like many who are new to commerce, he failed to realize that great profit only comes with great risk. So he sank all his money into the most expensive commodities, and of course his caravan was captured and looted, and he lost everything.
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b2:merchant_quest_4b3|As a consequence, it seems, our captain turned to villainy to recoup his fortune. I supposed I'd do the same if, the Seven forbid, I ever faced indebtedness and ruination. Now, any watch captain worth his salary will have a few thieves and robbers on his payroll, to inform on the rest, but our captain decides to employ these bastards wholesale. He brings them into the town, lets them do as they will, and takes a share of their take. You've heard of poachers turning gamekeepers? Well, in this unfortunate world, sometimes gamekeepers will turn poacher. Luckily, there's are still a few brave, honest souls in the watch who've told me how he works.
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b3:merchant_quest_4b4|Now -- here's my plan. I could bring this to the attention of {s4}, but that would mean an inquiry, my word against the captain's, and witnesses can be bought and evidence destroyed, or maybe the whole thing will be forgotten if the enemy comes across the border again, and all I'll get for my trouble is a knife in the ribs. In time of war, you see, a {s0}'s eye wanders far from {reg4?her:his} domain, and {reg4?her:his} subjects suffer. So I've got another idea. I've got a small group of townsfolk together, some men in my employ and some others who've lost relatives to these bandits, and we'll storm the captain's home and bring him in chains before {s4}, hopefully with a few captured bandits to explain how things stack up.
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b4:merchant_quest_4b5|All I need now is someone to lead my little army into battle -- and I can't think of anyone better than you. So, what do you say?
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b5:merchant_quest_4b6|How do I know that you're telling me the truth?
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b6:merchant_quest_4b7|Oh, well, I suppose it's possible that I found a dozen bandits who were willing to give their lives to give a passing stranger a false impression of life in old {s4}... Well, I guess you can't really know if my word is good, but I reckon you've learned by now that my money is good, and there's another 100 stags, or maybe a bit more, that's waiting for you if you'll do me this last little favor. So what do you say?
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4b8|All right. I'll lead your men.
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4_decline|I'm sorry. This is too much, too fast. I need time to think.
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b8:merchant_quest_4b9|Splendid. It's been a long time since I staked so much on a single throw of the dice, and frankly I find it exhilarating. My men are ready to move on your word. Are you ready?
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_accept|Yes. Give them the sign.
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_decline|Not now. I will need to rest before I can fight again.
; dlga_merchant_quest_4_accept:close_window|Good! Now -- strike hard, strike fast, and the captain and his henchmen won't know what hit them. May the Seven be with you!
; dlga_merchant_quest_4_decline:close_window|Right. I can keep my men standing by. If you let this go too long, then I suppose that I shall have to finish this affair without you, but I would be most pleased if you could be part of it as well. For now, take what time you need.
; dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window|Very well. I shall hunt for bandits.
; dlga_merchant_quest_2a:merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome|Why don't you come with us?
; dlga_merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome:merchant_quest_2a|Because I'm paying you to go take care of it. That's the short answer. The long answer is that I've got some leads to follow up here in town, and I have just as much chance of getting knocked on my head as you, if that's what you're asking. But I respect your question. Now, what do you say?
; dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window.1|I cannot deal with this matter at this time.
; dlga_merchant_quest_3a:close_window|Very well. I go now to attack the bandits in their lair, and find your brother.
; dlga_merchant_quest_3a:close_window.1|I cannot deal with this matter at this time.
; dlga_start:merchant_quest_persuasion|I'm leaving for Pentos soon, are you sure you would not like to reconsider joining me?
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_1_prologue_3|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_2|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_3|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_4b8|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:close_window|As I said, I've decided to stay here.
; dlga_merchant_quest_2:merchant_quest_2a|Now -- go find and defeat that group of bandits.
; dlga_merchant_quest_3:merchant_quest_3a|Now -- go attack that bandit hideout, get my brother back, and show those brigands what happens to those who threaten my household.
; dlga_start:close_window.10|Oh -- thank the heavens... Thank the heavens... Am I safe?
; dlga_start:merchant_closing_statement_2|Ah... {playername}. Things didn't go quite so well as I had hoped. {s5} couldn't quite find it in {reg4?her:him} to overlook my little breach of the peace. Oh, {reg4?she:he}'s grateful enough that I got rid of {reg4?her:his} crooked captain -- a guard who'll let in bandits will let in an enemy army, if the price is right -- but {reg4?she:he} can't exactly have me running around here as a lasting reminder of {reg4?her:his} failure to take care of things {reg4?herself:himself}.
; dlga_merchant_closing_statement_2:merchant_closing_statement_3|That hardly seems fair...
; dlga_merchant_closing_statement_3:merchant_closing_statement_4|Fair? This is not heaven, {my boy/my girl}! Kings do what they will, and the rest of us do as they must. {reg4?She:He} didn't string me up, and instead gave me time to sell my properties -- even put in a word with the other merchants that they best pay me a fair price, too.

Reclaiming my throne will be no simple matter.The {s0} of our realm have all sworn oaths of homage to {s11}.

; dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2:lord_pretalk|Piffle. You were supposed to remove him, not give him a sermon and send him on his way. He had better do as you say, or you'll both regret it. Here, this is half the money I promised you. Don't say a word, {playername}, you're lucky to get even that. I have little use for {men/women} who cannot follow orders.

; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you! I wanted TWO prisoners, {playername} -- what you've brought me is one step short of useless! I already know everything the spy knows, it was the handler I was after. Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|I asked you for two prisoners, {playername}, not one. Two. Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler, the more important one of the pair.

However, you'll understand if I pay you half the promised reward for what is but half a success.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you are nothing short of totally incompetent. Failing to capture both the spy AND {reg0?her:his} handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure. Forget any reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it.

; dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were 3 groups of serfs that I charged you to return. 3. Not {reg17}. I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away.

; dlga_lord_truce_offer:lord_pretalk|On second thought, such an accord would not be in my interests.
; dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2|Hmm. I could use my considerable influence to arrange a pardon for you, {playername}, but there are some who see you as an enemy and will not be satisfied unless you pay tribute.

; dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window.1|Excellent, {playername}. I'll use the coin to smooth the feathers of those that can oppose your pardon, and I'm sure that word will soon spread that you are no longer an enemy of {s4}.
; dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny:lord_pretalk|Then there's nothing I can do for you, {playername}. No silver, no pardon.
; dlga_lord_talk:lord_active_mission_1|About the task you gave me...
; dlga_lord_talk:lord_switch_to_spouse|Let us discuss matters related to our household.
; dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:lord_pretalk|Let us wait until we are in a hall, {s0}, as it is difficult to deal with household inventories and such matters in the field.
; dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:spouse_talk|Certainly, {s0}
; dlga_lord_talk:lord_request_mission_ask|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_lord_talk:wildfire_talk2|Do you own a valyrian dagger?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3|I do, I do. A fine thing, quite exquisite. Forged in the fires of the Freehold, you know. I own quite a collection actually.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4|Can I convince you to let me buy one of them?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5|I suppose that could be arranged. I shall require 10000 coins for one of my daggers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk|Very well. Here is the gold.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk.1|I can't afford that.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.1|Of course I do. I am a triarch of Volantis, of the blood of Old Valyria. We are the heirs to the Dragonlords, and house Vhassar is the most noble of all the families who live within the Black Walls. We have several artifacts from the Freehold, daggers, ingots of steel, weapons of great importance.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.1|I suppose that could be arranged. The elections are almost upon us, and the people should be mollified by games and feasts, that they may know my great power. But alas, such spectacle is not cheap. I shall require 15000 coins for one of my daggers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk.2|I can't afford that.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.2|What noble in Volantis does not? We where the closest allies of the Freehold, the first daughter of Old Valyria. Amongst the families living within the Black Walls, valyrian daggers are as plentiful as the dates upon a palm tree. I use one as a paper weight, hah!
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.2|Bah! Like a common merchant? Who do you think I am? I am of the blood of the dragons! How dare you! No, I cannot sell you a dagger. But ah, what kind of man would I be if I was not generous! You can have a dagger from me, on one condition. Bring me a bottle of Tyroshi Pear Brandy. I have a thirst, and nothing quenches it like a large goblet of brandy. Say what you will of the tyroshi, but they know how to make liquor.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk.3|Very well. Here is the brandy.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk.4|I will return with a bottle of brandy.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.3|Ah, yes. A fine blade. I own quite a few. They make for very good gifts, especially when one looks to obtain favorable winds for ones fleet. I myself favor Bakkalon, but I've heard that Gomon Eldros sacrificed one to Boash, the Blind God! Can you imagine that?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.3|I suppose that could be arranged. Daggers are not good for much, you know. I don't need one to cut my meat, an ordinary one suffices for that, and what else can one do with it? I shall require 5000 coins for one of my daggers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk.5|I can't afford that.
; dlga_lord_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2|I've cleared out the pirates on Bloodstone.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3|Well, I'm glad they have been taken care of. Those islands are usually teeming with outlaws, but it haven't been too bad lately.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk4|I imagine their death might be worth a reward.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk4:pj_wildfire_talk5|Reckon so, do you?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6|I suppose the people of Tyrosh could find some way to thank you for your services. Here, take this.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:pj_wildfire_talk7|Thank you.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk7:lord_pretalk|My pleasure. Less pirates means more trade.
; dlga_lord_talk:wildfire_talk2.1|My lord, what will you do about Renly?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.4|Renly... What has Renly ever done to earn a throne? He sits in council and jests with Littlefinger, and at tourneys he dons his splendid suit of armor and allows himself to be knocked off his horse by a better man. That is the sum of my brother Renly, who wants to be king. It is not a question of wanting.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk5|The throne is mine, as Robert's heir. That is law. After me, it must pass to my daughter, unless Selyse should finally give me a son. I am king. Wants do not enter into it. I have a duty to my daughter. To the realm. Even to Robert. He loved me but little, I know, yet he was my brother. The Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him. She may have murdered him as well, as she murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark. For such crimes there must be justice. I mean to scour King's Landing clean, to bring justice to lord and peasant alike, and for that I must sit the Iron Throne.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6|How can I be of service, my lord?
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7|How indeed, {playername}? Renly is my younger brother. By law the throne belongs to me. By all the laws of gods and men. He intends to flaunt these laws, and for that there must be justice.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8|I, Stannis Baratheon, King of Westeros, hereby charge you with bringing justice to Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End. I denounce him, and attaint him, I strip him of all rank and title, of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death. Do your duty, {playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:wildfire_talk9|The kinslayer is accursed in the eyes of the gods, your Grace.
; dlga_wildfire_talk9:wildfire_talk10|I stopped believing in gods the day I saw the Windproud break up across the bay. Any gods so monstrous as to drown my mother and father would never have my worship, I vowed. In King’s Landing, the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the Seven, but all I ever saw of either was made by men. Men make justice, and it is all a king must do.
; dlga_wildfire_talk10:lord_pretalk|I never asked for this crown. Gold is cold and heavy on the head, but so long as I am the king, I have a duty. I shall bring justice to Westeros, a thing Renly understands as little as war. The lords must pay the traitors price, and when I come into my kingdom, they shall. Every man shall reap what he has sown, from the highest lord to the lowest gutter rat. And some will lose more than the tips off their fingers, I promise you. They have made my kingdom bleed, and I do not forget that.
; dlga_lord_talk:wildfire_talk2.2|Lord Renly is dead.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.5|Renly... The Iron Throne is mine by rights. All those who deny it are my foes. Yet Renly was my brother. I did not like the man he grew to be, but I remember him as a boy... If he had done his duty by me, I would sit the throne now, and he would be my chosen heir.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:lord_pretalk|Those lords who supported him, however... Good men and true will fight for Joffrey, wrongly believing him the true king. A northman might even say the same of Robb Stark. But these lords who flocked to my brother’s banners knew him for a usurper. They turned their backs on their rightful king for no better reason than dreams of power and glory, and I have marked them for what they are.
; dlga_lord_talk:combined_political_quests|Do you think we can work together to advance our standings in this realm?

One could enter {s24}, either in disguise or openly, then walk up to the prison guard and try to take the keys by force. However, getting out may be difficult. The garrison may be slow to react, but even so, you are likely to find yourself fighting a half dozen or more of the enemy at once, with limited space in which to maneuver.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_2:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3|I have written a fake letter to {s15}, bearing my own seal, which implicates {reg4?her:him} in a conspiracy with us to stage a coup in {s14}, in my favour. If we can make {s13} believe the letter is genuine, {reg3?she:he} will deal with {s15} very swiftly. Of course, the challenge there is to convince {s13} that the letter is indeed real...

; dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|No, I will not sully myself with this dishonourable scheme.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_4:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_5|This is where you come into play. You'll take the letter to {s14}, then give it to one of your soldiers and instruct him to take it to {s15}. I will have one of my spies inform the town garrison so that your man will be arrested on his way. The guards will then find the letter and take it to {s13}. They'll torture your man, of course, to try and get the truth out of him, but all he knows is that you ordered the letter to be delivered to {s15} under the utmost secrecy. {s13} knows you serve me, and the fool will certainly believe the whole charade.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_7:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8|There is one more thing... Your messenger must be someone trustworthy. If you sent the letter with a simple peasant, someone expendable, {s13} might suspect a plot. {reg3?She:He} may have the wits of a snail, but even a snail can see the obvious. Give the letter to someone of rank. One of your {s9}, perhaps.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9|What? I can't send one of my trusted {s9} to his death!
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin|Then a {s8} it will be.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10|Come now, {playername}. There is a place for sentimentality, but this is not it. Believe me, you shall be generously compensated, and what is the purpose of soldiers if not to die at our say-so?

; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.2|A group of my soldiers were captured in a recent skirmish with the enemy. Thankfully we have a mutual agreement of prisoner exchange, and they will release my men, but they want us to give them prisoners of equal rank and number. Prisoners I don't currently have.

; dlga_enemy_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|I have a friend here, an old warrior, who is very sick.

This man is dear to me, {playername}, but he's also stubborn as a hog and refuses to have anyone look at his injury because he doesn't trust the physicians here. I have heard that you've a capable surgeon with you. If you would let your surgeon come here and have a look, {reg3?she:he} may be able to convince him to give his consent to an operation. Please, I will be deeply indebted to you if you grant me this request.

; dlga_spouse_talk:spouse_household_possessions|Let us take inventory of our household possessions
; dlga_spouse_household_possessions:spouse_pretalk|Anyway, that is the content of our larder.
; dlga_spouse_talk:close_window|We shall speak later, my {wife/husband}
; dlga_wedding_ceremony_bride_vow:wedding_ceremony_player_vow|My husband, I hearby pledge to be your wife, to stand with you in good times and bad. May the heavens smile upon us and bless us with children, livestock, and land.

; dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk.2|A splendid idea, {s0}. However, our realm has recently had a feast. Perhaps we should wait another {reg3} days before we organize another one.

However, to not insult our guests, we must make sure that we can provide a large and varied repast, for the lords, their families, and their retinues.

; dlga_start:close_window.19|How wonderful it is... In a short while we shall be married! However, I should point out that, in the remaining few days, it is not customary for us to speak too much together.
; dlga_start:close_window.20|Em, {playername}, you might not be used to our wedding customs, but I had hoped that someone would tell you... Speak first to my {s11}, {s4}.
; dlga_start:close_window.21|I do not know where to find my {s11} {s10}, who by tradition should preside over our wedding. Perhaps we should wait until {reg4?she:he} can be found...

; dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive|So great is my loneliness! How I miss my family!
; dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.1|You are a cad, to hold a {reg65?lady:free-spirited lad} like this...
; dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.2|It is strange. On occasion you have shown me such kindness, and yet you continue to hold me here against my will.
; dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.3|Why haven't my family paid my ransom? You may hold me as prisoner, but it seems that you care for me more than they do!
; dlga_lady_stranded_next:close_window|Greetings, {s0}. The tides of war have left me stranded here in this fortress, but I will shortly be departing. 
; dlga_start:lady_talk_refugee|{playername} -- I assume that you, as a {man/lady} of honor, will accord gentle-born {reg65?ladies:lads} such as ourselves the right to return to our families, and not demand a ransom.

; dlga_lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions:close_window.1|No, {playername} -- I cannot afford to fritter away my good name, and neither can you.
; dlga_start:lady_start|Oh, {playername} -- I have heard that you won your duel with {s10}. I'm grateful that you have delivered me from that {reg3?woman:man}'s attentions!
; dlga_start:lady_start.1|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Clearly, {reg3?she:he} was not worthy of my affections.
; dlga_lady_duel_rep_1:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Oh, such foolishness, that {men/people} should fight over me! Sigh... But it is a bit romantic, I suppose.
; dlga_lady_duel_rep_2:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Honor now demands that {reg0?she:he} and I no longer meet... I was fond of {reg0?her:him}, you know. You did me no service by fighting {reg0?her:him}.
; dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1|My dear {playername}, how joyous to see you again! I heard you gave that vile {s13} a well-deserved lesson. I hope {reg3?she:he} never forgets {reg3?her:his} humiliation. I've a reward for you, but I fear it's little compared to what you've done for me.

; dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2.1|{s66}, this is far too much!

; dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2:lady_pretalk|{s10}
; dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed|I was told that you sought satisfaction from {s13} to prove my innocence, {playername}. It was a fine gesture, and I thank you for your efforts.
; dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2|I beg your forgiveness for my defeat, {s65}...
; dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2:lady_pretalk|It matters not, dear {playername}. You tried. The truth cannot be proven at the point of a sword, but you willingly put your life at stake for my honour. That alone will convince many of my innocence.
; dlga_start:lady_escort_lady_succeeded|Thank you for escorting me here, {playername}. Please accept this gift as a token of my gratitude. I hope we shall meet again sometime in the future.
; dlga_lady_escort_lady_succeeded:close_window|It was an honor to serve you, {s65}.

; dlga_start:lady_meet_end|You must be {playername}. We have just had the honor of watching you distinguish yourself in the recent melee{s8}.
; dlga_start:lady_meet_end.1|You must be {playername}. My {s15} {s16} has spoken most highly of you. I am delighted to make your acquaintance.
; dlga_start:lady_premeet|I say, you don't look familiar...
; dlga_start:close_window.25|Ah, {playername}. How good it is to see you again. However, I believe that I am required elsewhere.
; dlga_start:lady_start.3|{playername} -- how good it is to see you. (Whispers:) I still remember your visits fondly.
; dlga_start:lady_meet_end.2|Ah, {playername}. How spendid it was to see you distinguish yourself in the recent tourney.
; dlga_start:lady_start.4|{s12}
; dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed|I have sad news. I have become betrothed to {s5} -- against my will, I should say! Oh {playername} - I would so much rather be wed to you!
; dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed.1|Good {playername} -- I have become betrothed to {s5}. It is now no longer seemly for us to see each other like this.
; dlga_lady_start:lady_other_suitor|I must tell you -- there is another lord who has been paying me attentions, although I cannot abide {reg0?her:him}. I fear {reg0?she:he} has designs on me, and may try to force me to wed against my will.
; dlga_lady_start:lady_talk|{s11}It is probably not suitable for us to tarry too long here in conversation, but I would hope to see you again soon.

; dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.4|What brings you here today?
; dlga_lady_proposal_pending:close_window|No word so far...
; dlga_lady_proposal_pending:lady_proposal_pending_end|On second thought, now is not the time for us to marry
; dlga_lady_proposal_pending_end:close_window|{s11}
; dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_suggest_elope|Never! We must elope together at once!
; dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_pretalk|Perhaps I may still be able to change your {s11}'s mind
; dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_conclude_relationship|So be it -- let us then part
; dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship|Good {playername} -- you are a good and kind man, but a lady cannot defy her family. Such things are not done!
; dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_other_suitor|As you may know, I have been entertaining offers from a number of {gentlemen/suitors} such as yourself. I am not yet at a stage where I can commit to any of them.
; dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.1|Ah {playername}, you must realize. You are still finding your way in the world. I have great affection for you, {playername}, but I will not consign myself to obscurity.
; dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.2|Ah {playername}, although you are kind to me, I am not certain enough of your moral fiber to risk such a thing. Although I bear little affection for my betrothed, it would be a weighty thing to go against my family's wishes, and I am not certain enough of you to take that step.
; dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.3|Good {playername} -- to elope would be to throw away my ties with my family, which are everything to me! I have a considerable affection for you, but I am not sure that I am prepared to risk that.
; dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.4|Good {playername} -- I am not used to the hardships of campaigning as you are. I want a home to call my own. If you were lord of a castle or town with a great hall, I would gladly go there as your {reg0?wife:husband}, to be {reg0?mistress:keeper} of the household. But I do not wish to live like a hunted animal.
; dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_elope_agree|Elope with you? Yes -- we could do that. It is a great step to defy my family -- but a loveless marriage, and life without you, might be a far worse thing!

; dlga_lady_elope_agree_player_vows:close_window.1|Eh, what? This is all moving too fast...
; dlga_lady_elope_agree:lady_conclude_relationship|Oh, really? My dear -- I could never separate a {reg65?lady:young lad} from {reg65?her:his} family like that...
; dlga_lady_conclude_relationship:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm|So I suppose our time together must come to an end...

One of the most insidious is {s13}. {reg0?She:He} is going around making terrible accusations against me, impugning my honour at every turn! Because {reg0?she:he} cannot harm my {reg1?wife:husband} directly, {reg0?she:he} is using me as a target to try and stain our name. You should hear the awful things {reg0?she:he}'s said!

; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_4:siege_won_seneschal_5|Thank you, my {lord/lady}. If you do not mind my impudence, may I inquire as to what you wish to do with the castle?
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6|I will sell it to another lord.

; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2|According to our laws and traditions, you can do one of several things. First, you could station a garrison here to protect the castle from any immediate counterattacks, then request an audience with some wealthy lord and ask him to make you an offer. It would be worth a tidy sum, believe you me. If you do not wish to sell, then you will have to find yourself a liege lord and protector who would accept homage from you. Without a royal investiture and an army at your back, you would have a difficult time holding on to the castle. Both you and {s1} would become great big targets for any man with a few soldiers and a scrap of ambition. 
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3|What do you mean, a liege lord and protector? I won this place by my own hand, I don't need anyone else!
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4|Of course you don't, my {lord/lady}. However, no lord in the land will recognize your claim to the castle unless it is verified by royal decree. They would call {s1} an outlaw stronghold and take it from you at the earliest opportunity. Surely not even you could stand against a whole army.
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4:siege_won_seneschal_6|Hmm. I'll give it some thought.
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_6:close_window|I am very pleased to hear it, my {lord/lady}. I am only trying to serve you to the best of my ability. Now, if at any time you find you have further need of me, I will be in the great hall arranging a smooth handover of the castle to your forces.

; dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window|I think that is a wise move. Good luck to you.
; dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.1|Your relations with {s4} are not all that they could be. As {reg4?she:he} is my {s11}, I can mediate to attempt to mend your quarrel. Perhaps the best way for me to do this would be to send {reg4?her:him} a gift -- a fur-trimmed velvet robe, perhaps. If you can provide me with a bolt of velvet and a length of furs, I can have one made and sent to {reg4?her:him.}
; dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.1|Splendid. I shall await the materials.
; dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.2|As you may realize, {s4} has many enemies among the lords of the {s5}. In particular, they feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to denounce {s4} to {reg4?her:his} face, you may reap much popularity -- although, of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him}, and risk being challenged to a duel.
; dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.3|As you may realize, many of us in the peerage of the {s5} consider {s4} to be {s7}, and a liability to our cause. We worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. People know my views on {s4} already, but if you were to denounce {reg4?her:him} to {reg4?her:his} face, you would further erode his standing -- and discourage our liege from entrusting {reg4?her:him} with any more power or responsibility. Of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him}, and risk being challenged to a duel.{s9}
; dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.2|We appreciate what you are doing. I find such intrigues distasteful, but it is all for the good of the {s5}.
; dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.3|Very well. It is always risky to involve yourself in intrigues of this sort, but in this case, I think you will benefit.
; dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.4|You and I have a common interest in seeking to curtail the rise of {s4}. I feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to tell our liege {s9} your opinion of {s4}, it might discourage {s9} from granting {s4} any further powers or responsibilities, at least for a while, and I would be much obliged to you.
; dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.4|We appreciate what you are doing. I find such intrigues distasteful, but it is all for the good of the {s5}.
; dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.5|I cannot think of anything right now, but we will have some items of mutual interest in the future.
; dlga_political_quest_suggested:political_quest_follow_on|I like that idea.

; dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_3:local_merchant_mercy_yes_4|Yes, of course. I'll do as you say.
; dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_4:local_merchant_mercy_yes_5|And if my lord hears so much of a hint of a complaint about this issue, then I'll come back for you, and it won't matter how much you scream for mercy then. Do you understand me?

; dlga_start:close_window.39|I will do as you say.

; dlga_fugitive_12:fugitive_22|I am looking for a runaway maiden called {s4}. You fit her description.

; dlga_fugitive_22:fugitive_32|I suppose there's no point pretending otherwise... I merely wanted to make a better life with my love. And he was so fair to look at! But...but my father will kill me for sure if I go back.
; dlga_fugitive_32:fugitive_42|I'm sure you have nothing to fear in returning to your village. The people there seemed a nice enough lot.
; dlga_fugitive_42:fugitive_52|And what would you know? You think I risked fleeing in the night over some love-struck boy? Fool! Terrible things happen in that village. Terrible things!
; dlga_fugitive_52:fugitive_72|Really? I won't ask what 'things', but you can stay here if you want.
; dlga_fugitive_52:fugitive_62|Get someone else to listen to your tales. Be off with you!

; dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result_2:close_window|I'll keep my ears open for other opportunities. You may want to ask again from time to time.
; dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:close_window|I guess I should leave now.
; dlga_start:ransom_broker_intro|Greetings to you, {s0}. You look like someone who should get to know me.
; dlga_ransom_broker_intro:ransom_broker_intro_2|Why is that?
; dlga_ransom_broker_intro_2:ransom_broker_info_talk|I broker ransoms for the poor wretches who are captured in these endless wars. Normally I travel between the salt mines and the slave markets on the coast, on commission from those whose relatives have gone missing. But if I'm out on my errands of mercy, and I come across a fellow dragging around a captive or two, well, there's no harm in a little speculative investment, is there? And you look like the type who might have a prisoner to sell.
; dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_families|What if their families can't pay?
; dlga_ransom_broker_families:ransom_broker_info_talk|Oh, then I spin them a few heartwarming tales of life on the galleys. You'd be surprised what sorts of treasures a peasant can dig out of his cowshed or wheedle out of his cousins, assuming he's got the proper motivation! And if in the end they cannot come up with the silver, then there are always slave merchants who are looking for galley slaves. One cannot do the Gods work with an empty purse, you see.
; dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_prices|What can I get for a prisoner?
; dlga_ransom_broker_prices:ransom_broker_info_talk|It varies. I fancy that I have a fine eye for assessing a ransom. There are a dozen little things about a man that will tell you whether he goes to bed hungry, or dines each night on soft dumplings and goose. The real money of course is in the gentry, and if you ever want to do my job you'll want to learn about every landowning family in the known world, their estates, their heraldry, their offspring both lawful and bastard, and, of course, their credit with the merchants.
; dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_me|Would you be able to ransom me if I were taken?
; dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_me:ransom_broker_info_talk|Of course. I'm welcome in every court. There's not many who can say that! So always be sure to keep a pot of coins buried somewhere, and a loyal servant who can find it in a hurry.
; dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thank you.
; dlga_start:ransom_broker_talk|Greetings. If you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
; dlga_ransom_broker_pretalk:ransom_broker_talk|Anyway, if you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
; dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners|Then you'd better bring your purse. I have got prisoners to sell.
; dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all|I want to sell all the prisoners I have with me.
; dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all_2|Let's see...  I'll give you {reg0} coins for your {reg1} {reg2?prisoners:prisoner}.  Do we have a deal?

; dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk|Greetings, friend. You look like the kind of {man/person} who'd do well to know me. I travel a lot all across all the world and keep an open ear. I can provide you information that you might find useful. For a meager price of course.
; dlga_start:tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks|Greetings, {playername}. I saw your companion {s10} at a tavern in {s11} some days ago. I thought you might like to know.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk|Thanks. I'll go and find {reg3?her:him} there.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk.1|Thanks, but I don't really care.
; dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk.1|Greetings, {playername}.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_pretalk:tavern_traveler_talk|Yes?
; dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms|What can you tell me about this land?
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2|The Free cities of Essos have been trying to eliminate each other since the Bleeding Years, more than three hundred years ago. Until recently, Westeros was ruled by a single king, but with Robert Baratheons death, the seven kingdoms have fragmented, with both his brothers and his son claiming the throne, and Robb Stark fighting for independence. I hear that the Dothraki have been causing trouble in the east, but I seldom travel that far, and either way, the Demon Road, the Ruins of Valyria and the Dothraki Sea make the journey dangerous. Only fools travel that way! Anyhow, at least the current chaos, gripping the world, must present an adventurer such as yourself with quite the opportunities. With some luck and skill, you can make a name for yourself here, amass a fortune perhaps, or gain great power. Opportunities are endless and so are the rewards, if you are willing to risk your life for them.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3|Tell me more about these opportunities.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:close_window|Thank you. That was all I needed to know.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Well, you probably know everything I could tell you already. You seem to be doing pretty well.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a|The archons, kings, princes and lords will pay good money for sellswords if they are engaged in a war. If you have done a bit of fighting, speaking with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a sellsword contract. However the real rewards come if you can manage to become a vassal to a king or a lord. A vassal can own villages, castles and towns and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these estates. Normally, only nobles of the realm own land in this way, but in time of war, a king will not hesitate to accept someone who distinguishes {himself/herself} on the battlefield as a vassal, and grant {him/her} the right to own land.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|It is not unheard-of for adventurers to renounce allegiance to king altogether, declare themselves kings, and claim land in their own name. This is a difficult path, however, as the great nobles of the land, with their long ancestries, are not likely to accept such upstarts as their liege. Such rulers would need to be very careful in establishing their right to rule, or they would be set upon from all sides.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5|It might be easier for an adventurer like yourself to pledge support to an existing king's rival.  There are many such pretenders in the world -- those who are born to the right family, who go around and stir up trouble saying they have a better claim to the throne than the current ruler. If those claim holders could find supporters, they could easily start civil wars and perhaps even replace the ruler one day.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6|Interesting. Where can I find these claim holders?
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:close_window|I guess I heard enough already. Thank you.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6:tavern_traveler_pretalk|A claim holder's life would be in danger in his own country of course. Therefore, they usually stay at rival courts, raising support and hoping to find someone willing to champion their cause. I usually hear news about some of them, and may be able to tell you their location with some precision. But of course, I would ask for a little something for such a service.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_pretender_location|I want to know the location of a claimant.

; dlga_mystic_merchant_talk:close_window|No, I must leave now.
; dlga_start:ranger_introduce_1|Hail and well met. I am Master Grazmak mo Senko, of the great city of Astapor, most favoured of the great Harpy, the jewel of the east and heir to the Ghiscari Empire!
; dlga_ranger_introduce_1:ranger_introduce_2|Greetings. Where is Astapor?
; dlga_ranger_introduce_2:ranger_introduce_3|Astapor lies in Slaver's Bay, close to the Isle of Cedars. The Good Masters, of whom I am amongst, deal with the most magnificent soldiers in the world, the Unsullied! Trained from childhood, they're the fiercest, most stalwart, most loyal soldiers in the world! None might stand before them! Being the barbarian that you are, I imagine that you are not familiar with the story of the Three Thousand of Qohor? Khal Temmo and his khalasar was defeated by three thousand Unsullied. Only four hundred remained at the end of the battle, but Khal Temmo was dead and so was all his sons and twelve thousand of his warriors!
; dlga_ranger_introduce_3:ranger_introduce_4|I see. You're selling slave soldiers. If they're really that good, why are they not part of every army in the world?
; dlga_ranger_introduce_4:ranger_introduce_5|Bah! Petty lords and knights, would-be kings and princes, filthy khals and greedy magisters, they do not understand warfare. They think any soldier is the same. The Unsullied training starts a age five and is from dawn to dusk. It is brutal, designed not only to teach them how to fight, but to strip away all individuality, empathy, and self-worth. Only one in three survive, and those that fail at any stage are killed. They are fully castrated - penis and testicles cut - and their manhoods burned at the altar of the Lady of Spears. They regularly consume an elixir called the Wine of Courage to deaden their sensitivity to pain. They will obey every command, even fall on their sword should you wish it.
; dlga_ranger_introduce_5:ranger_introduce_6|You have roused my interest Master Grazmak, what can you offer me?
; dlga_ranger_introduce_6:ranger_master_talk|Usually, we sell Unsullied by the century, so as to not split them up. They have a tendency to become fat and bloated. Keeping them together ensures that their discipline and fighting prowess keeps. However, I have heard worrying news from the east, talk of dragons and brimstones. So I am looking to settle down in this area and as such will only be able to sell Unsullied in small groups.
; dlga_start:ranger_master_talk|Hello again, {playername}.
; dlga_ranger_master_talk:ranger_master_hire_male|I'd like to hire some Unsullied.
; dlga_ranger_master_talk:ranger_master_hire_himself|I'd like you to take up residence at my place and instruct young recruits about your way of warfare.
; dlga_ranger_master_talk:custom_master_reassign_location|I would like you to take up residence somewhere else.
; dlga_ranger_master_talk:ranger_master_customize|Can you tell me the history of Slaver's Bay?
; dlga_ranger_master_customize:ranger_master_talk|When the Doom came to Valyria, the ancient and proud cities of Astapor, Meereen and Yunkai rose once again to prominence. We deal in slaves, and it has made us rich and powerful. The Meereenese train slaves of all sorts, while the Yunkai specialize in bedslaves. In Astapor, we train the Unsullied, the heirs of the lockstep legions of Old Ghis. Further to the south, New Ghis claims to be the true heir to the Ghiscari Empire, but I say it is we, the masters of Astapor, who are the true descendants of Grazdan the Great!

; dlga_start:minstrel_1|Greetings to you, {most noble lord/most noble lady}.
; dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_job_description|What is it you do?
; dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_questions|I have some questions about courtship.
; dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_poem|Can you teach me any songs?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach|I can teach you the song, 'The Storming of the Castle of Love.' It is short enough to be easily learned. It is an allegoric poem, replete with symbols and metaphor. It describes how a brave prince from the Stormlands wins the heart of his lady by learning the virtues of chivalry, becoming a true and noble knight. Its theme -- that the role of a woman is to inspire but also civilize a man -- is appreciated by some noble ladies, but not all.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.1|I can teach you the song, 'The Maidens Desire.' It is a lyrical poem, which can be interpreted either erotically or spiritually. The lover realizes the majesty of the Seven by gazing upon the body of his beloved. I believe that it appeals to women of a certain romantic temperament, but you risk scandalizing or boring others.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.2|I can teach you the tragic ballad of the Rains of Castamere. It's a fairly recent song, commisioned by Lord Tywin Lannister after his victory over the rebellious lords Reyne and Tarbeck. They denounced their allegiance to the old Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, Tytos Lannister, but his son and heir Ser Tywin soon had them regretting their pride.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.3|I can teach you part of the song of Florian and Jonquil. It is a heroic tale, full of blood and battle. Florian the Fool sees the highborn maiden Jonquil bathing in the pool near Maidenpool. He is taken with her, but sadly she is promised to marry the King of the Rivers and Hills, a vain and cruel man. Knowing that he will never be allowed to even kiss her, Florian challenges the arrogant king to a battle of arms and wits for the hand of fair Jonquil.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.4|I can teach you the song The Bear and the Maiden Fair. It's a rather ribald song, mostly enjoyed in Westeros by lowborn and highborn alike. It describes in a humorous tone the story of three boys, a bear and a goat going to a fair, where the bear rescues a young innocent maiden who was hoping for a knight.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2|To teach it to you, I will need some hours of your time -- and, of course, a small fee for my services. About 300 silver coins would suffice.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_pretalk|I believe you already know the songs I am best equipped to teach.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3|Yes -- teach me that one

; dlga_minstrel_courtship_prequestions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|Can I answer any other questions for you?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_role|Is there a place for me in the game of love?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_meet|How would a suitor meet a lady?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo|Having met a lady, how would the suitor woo her?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_nobles|Tell me about marriage and love among the nobility
; dlga_minstrel_nobles:minstrel_nobles_2|Nobles are an odd lot. A daughter is a political asset, to be given away to a lord with whom her father wishes to make an alliance. Yet the great families of this land idealize pure love between man and woman, and I have seen many a hardened warrior weep copious tears at the doomed ardour of Jonquil and Florian in the songs -- even as he made plans to break his own daughter's heart.
; dlga_minstrel_nobles_2:minstrel_nobles_3|Fathers differ, of course. Some nobles will let their daughters choose a husband who pleases them. Others, however, feel that to allow their daughters any choice at all would be to diminish their own authority, and insist on imposing a groom whether she likes it or not.
; dlga_minstrel_nobles_3:minstrel_prequestions|But the majority will steer a middle course -- they will want to make the final decision about a groom, but will weigh their daughter's preferences heavily. Among other factors, a happy marriage is more likely to produce heirs. So, there is a place for courtship, and for the use of skill and passion to win a lady's heart.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_daughter_father|What if a lady and her father disagree about a suitor?
; dlga_minstrel_daughter_father:minstrel_daughter_father_2|It happens sometimes that a bride elopes. This is a major blow to the father's prestige, leading to lasting enmities. Indeed, it is possible that a war may be fought over a woman. Now, that is a fine topic for a song.
; dlga_minstrel_daughter_father_2:minstrel_prequestions|In the end, however, most brides will submit to their parents' choice. A noblewoman's family is everything to her, and few are brave enough to risk its disapproval for the sake of man she barely knows. She may pine for her lover, but still accept the groom -- and without tragic love, what would we have to sing about?
; dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_player_role_2|Of course! Highborn ords make a great deal of lineage, but in the end, lands and money speak louder than one's ancestors. Even though you are a foreigner, if you are coming up in the world, then many parents will consider you a fine catch.
; dlga_minstrel_player_role_2:minstrel_player_role_3|You will have to compete with many other lords of your realm, however, who will have an advantage -- they have known these ladies from childhood, and will have been sized up as grooms by carefully discerning mothers and aunts. Some ladies may be fascinated by the stranger, yet opt for the familiar.
; dlga_minstrel_player_role_3:minstrel_prequestions|So know this -- you may have your heart broken. But to enter the arena of love fearing heartbreak is like entering the battlefield fearing the enemy's arrows. Be brave, and shrug off the sting of rejection, and victory may yet be yours.
; dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_female_player_3|I will speak bluntly. Most of the {ladies/lords} of this land are looking for a demure {lad/maiden}, whose skin as fair as snow -- and your skin is burnt brown by the sun. They want a {boy/maiden} whose voice is soft as bells -- and your voice is hoarse from commanding {soldiers/men} in battle. Also, although the {ladies/lords} of this realm appreciate poems about love, most also want heirs, and few {men/women} can ride and fight while {caring for their children/with child}.
; dlga_minstrel_female_player_3:minstrel_prequestions|However, not all {ladies/lords} will be so conventionally minded. We poets sing of shield {boys/maidens} and of {hunters/huntresses}, of {lads/women} who forged their own path without having sacrificed the chance for love. I would not tell you that it would be easy for you to find a devoted {wife/husband} who will accept your ways, but I would not say that it is impossible.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_spouse_benefits|What advantage is there in seeking a {wife/husband}?
; dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may forge a strong alliance with the bride's family, and a wife may also assist you in manipulating the politics of the realm to your advantage.
; dlga_minstrel_wife_benefits_2:minstrel_prequestions|What's more, most of the great families have at some point intermarried with royalty, which would boost your own claim to rule -- should you ever choose to assert it...
; dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2.1|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may have access to the groom's castles and properties, and be able to work with him to advance both of your standings in the realm.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet:minstrel_player_advice_meet_2|Every so often, a king or great lord will hold a feast. In towns they will often be accompanied by jousting and a melee, and in castles they will be accompanied by hunts. The feasts provide a chance for the lords to repair some of the rivalries that may undermine the strength of the realm. They also provide an opportunity for families to show off their eligible daughters, and ladies will often be allowed to mingle unsupervised with the guests.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet_2:minstrel_prequestions|If you have the opportunity, you may attempt to pay the lady a compliment. This indicates to her that you are a potential suitor, and she will usually know if she wishes you to continue your suit. Incidentally, if you come to her fresh from having distinguished yourself in the tourney or in the hunt, then you may make a stronger first impression than otherwise.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo:minstrel_player_advice_woo_2|To woo a lady takes a certain amount of time and patience, and several meetings spaced over a period of months. A lady who is interested in you will often find ways of letting you know if she wishes you to come visit her. Alternately, you may simply go and ask her father or brother for permission. If you do not have permission from her guardian, it may be possible to arrange an assignation through other means.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo_3|Having arranged an assignment, you may then attempt to charm her and win her favor. Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of this is finding a topic of conversation. Most noblewomen lead a cloistered life, at least until they are married, and thus will have little to say that will interest you. On other hand, she will soon tire of hearing of your own deeds in the outside world.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_3:minstrel_player_advice_woo_4|One time-tested mode of courtship is simply to recite a popular poem, and discuss it. This way, you are both on an equal footing, and neither will have an advantage in knowledge or experience. Of course, different ladies will have different tastes in poetry.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_4:minstrel_player_advice_woo_5|At some point, you will be able to discuss directly the issue of marriage. She will then let you know if you measure up to what she wants in a husband. Some ladies will coolly assess who is the most prestigious of her suitors, others will be guided by their passions. Some will look to your companions, to see whether you are the kind of husband who will treat her as an equal, while others will follow the lead of their fathers.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_5:minstrel_prequestions|At any rate, it is a challenging business -- and do not forget, you may find that your suit prospers with a lady, only to have it falter on a father's political ambitions. So you must ask yourself: are you willing to risk disappointment and heartbreak? Alternately, are you willing to throw away your standing in society, to make enemies of allies, in pursuit of a forbidden love? Because if you are, then perhaps some day we will write poems about you.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_job_description|What is it that you poets and musicians do again?
; dlga_minstrel_job_description:minstrel_courtship_prequestions|I compose and write songs for the lords of the land, and their ladies. Sometimes I sing about war, sometimes about the virtues of kings, and sometimes, for the more sophisticated audiences, about the virtues of wine. For most audiences, however, I sing of love.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_pretalk|No, that is all.

; dlga_bayle1_master_talk:bayle1_master_customize.1|I heard sailors talk of the Doom. Can you tell me more?
; dlga_bayle1_master_customize:bayle1_master_talk|People say that the Doom still rules Valyria. Whatever that means. All I know is that most people who venture too close to the ruins are never seen again. It is said that demons roam the great empty halls of the dragonlords.
; dlga_bayle1_master_talk:close_window.1|Thank you for your time, captain.

; dlga_bayle2_introduce_2:bayle2_master_talk|The curse of Valyria.
; dlga_bayle2_master_talk:bayle2_master_customize|Tell me more.
; dlga_bayle2_master_customize:bayle2_master_talk|Valyria was once connected to the mainland of Essos. When the Doom came to the Freehold, the mountains split and spewed forth great amounts of molten rock. Great earthquakes devastated the continent, and the sea came rushing in, turning Valyria into several islands. The Fourteen Fires, the great fire mountains of Valyria, are now submerged, but still the fires burn and cause the sea to evaporate.

; dlga_bayle3_master_customize:bayle3_master_talk|Yunkai is also known as The Yellow City. It lies on the eastern coast of Slaver's Bay, close to the island of Yaros.

; dlga_daughter_dusk_introduce_2:daughter_dusk_master_talk|Oh {playername}, you are not from these parts are you? The people of Braavos call me the Daughter of the Dusk. I'm a courtesan, which is a fancy way of saying that I'm a whore. The only difference between me and those girls who get raw cunts lying on straw beds, is that I choose my lovers, and that I'm more often than not much more powerful than they are.
; dlga_daughter_dusk_master_talk:daughter_dusk_master_customize|You seem frank for a, ehm, lady of the evening.
; dlga_daughter_dusk_master_customize:daughter_dusk_master_customize2|What would you have me say, or do? I could flatter my lovers, laugh at their silly jokes and tell them how they make my knees shaky. But those kinds of tricks are for women like Bellegere, or the Mermaid Queen. I tell the men the harsh truths of the world, and they pay me as much for that truth as for what is between my legs. I suspect Bellegere does as well, but it's not commonly known.
; dlga_daughter_dusk_master_customize2:daughter_dusk_master_customize3|My lady, I find your frankness refreshing.
; dlga_daughter_dusk_master_customize2:close_window|A lady ought to be seen, not heard!
; dlga_daughter_dusk_master_customize3:daughter_dusk_finish|I'm sure you do, {playername}, just as I am sure you would cut off your own hand to get in the wet spot between my legs. Alas, I have a lover whom I quite enjoy at the moment. If not, I should have taken you with me to my quarters right this moment. You have a certain roguish face that I quite enjoy.
; dlga_daughter_dusk_finish:close_window|I bid you farewell then, my lady.
; dlga_daughter_dusk_master_talk:close_window|Excuse me.

; dlga_black_pearl_introduce_2:black_pearl_master_talk|The common people of Braavos call me the Black Pearl, and talk in secret of my wicked ways and illustrious ancestors. My real name is Bellegere Otherys.
; dlga_black_pearl_master_talk:black_pearl_master_customize|Who are your illustrious ancestors?
; dlga_black_pearl_master_customize:black_pearl_master_customize2|Oh, one of the Targaryen kings. Aegon the Unlikely to be frank, which does put a damper on the illustrious part. He sowed his seed with more vigor than most farmers, and had a crop to match. Say, {playername}, are you looking to make a name for yourself? I can help you along, in return for a favor. I am, by far, the most powerful woman in Braavos, adored by the common folk and lusted after by the princes. A kiss from me would put your name on everyones lips, and your name would become common knowledge in the city. All I ask in return is that you keep in mind the favor you owe me, to be repaid at a later date.
; dlga_black_pearl_master_customize2:black_pearl_master_customize3|I should conquer Valyria for a kiss from you, my lady!
; dlga_black_pearl_master_customize2:close_window|My lady, I fear I cannot be in debt to a woman as lovely as you!
; dlga_black_pearl_master_customize3:black_pearl_finish|Very well then, {playername}, meet me by the balcony. The light will make both of us look lovely, and my dress becomes positively transparent in such light, if you stand close to me.
; dlga_black_pearl_finish:close_window|Right!
; dlga_black_pearl_master_talk:close_window|Excuse me.
; dlga_start:close_window.133|I'm afraid I have an audience with the Iron Bank soon, {playername}, and I have to prepare myself.
; dlga_start:bella_introduce_1|Hi there, welcome to the Peach.
; dlga_bella_introduce_1:bella_introduce_2|Who are you?
; dlga_bella_introduce_2:bella_master_talk|I'm one of the girls working here. My mother used to work here too. My name is Bella, I'm named for the battle.
; dlga_bella_master_talk:bella_master_customize|Which battle was that?
; dlga_bella_master_customize:bella_master_customize2|Oh, the Battle of the Bells. When the king hid here, Lord Connington came to root him out. But then the lords Stark, Tully and Arryn descended on the town, and they defeated the army of the Mad King! Leslyn says my mother was the kings favorite, and that he rung her bell more than any of the other girls. Makes me the kings bastard daughter I suppose. Anyhow, you can have me for 3 silver.
; dlga_bella_master_customize2:bella_master_customize3|I've never slept with a kings bastard before. Let's go upstairs.
; dlga_bella_master_customize2:close_window|I'm sorry, I'm busy.
; dlga_bella_master_customize3:bella_finish|Oh my yes! My royal blood is all fiery!
; dlga_bella_finish:close_window|Hmpfh!
; dlga_bella_master_talk:close_window|Excuse me.
; dlga_start:close_window.134|I have to go help the Huntsman with his dogs. Visit me later!
; dlga_start:leslyn_introduce_1|Yes, sweetheart?
; dlga_leslyn_introduce_1:leslyn_introduce_2|Who are you?
; dlga_leslyn_introduce_2:leslyn_master_talk|I'm Leslyn, one of the girls here at the Peach.
; dlga_leslyn_master_talk:leslyn_master_customize|What do you mean by 'girls'?
; dlga_leslyn_master_customize:leslyn_master_customize2|Oh, I'm one of the whores here. I make my living on my back or on my knees. Or both. If that's your sort of thing, you can be the one on your knees or on your back. Price is 5 silver.
; dlga_leslyn_master_customize2:leslyn_master_customize3|Ah, I've never played the womans part. Let's go upstairs and do that!
; dlga_leslyn_master_customize2:close_window|I'm sorry, I'll have to get going.
; dlga_leslyn_master_customize3:leslyn_finish|Upstairs you go then, I'll go get the broom handle!
; dlga_leslyn_finish:close_window|Hmpfh!
; dlga_leslyn_master_talk:close_window|Excuse me.
; dlga_start:close_window.135|Word is there's outlaws in the area, I'll have to help the men repairing the gate.
; dlga_start:james_parr_introduce_1|Who are you?
; dlga_james_parr_introduce_1:james_parr_introduce_2|I am {playername}. Who are you?
; dlga_james_parr_introduce_2:close_window|I am Lord Parr, representative of the great bank of Norvos, the Bank of the Stars.
; dlga_start:close_window.136|I'm very busy {playername}! This septry have deep coffers, and I mean to milk them!

; dlga_etienne_lacroix_introduce_1:etienne_lacroix_introduce_2|I am {playername}. Now, who are you?
; dlga_etienne_lacroix_introduce_2:close_window|I am Enneite, son of Enneite, son of Enneite, who was son of Enneite. I've taken a vow of obedience, and serve the Seven.

; dlga_keith_larson_introduce_2:close_window|I am Keth, son of Lar, son of Lar, son of Keth! I'm here to sell the goats we took!
; dlga_start:close_window.139|Go away, or Keth, son of Lar, will chop off your head!
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1|What do you want?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2|Merely pass the time in a tavern. Do any interesting people ever come here?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window|I suppose Septon Germund is the man you'd talk to. Hear him tell it, he used to live a life of adventure down in the south. He's not here right now, but come back later, I'm sure you'll find him. Never far off when it comes to ale and wenches, even though he's a septon.
; dlga_start:close_window.140|What?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk|Greetings. I am Germund, the septon of this part of town. I used to live in the castle, but alas, Lord Manderly does not take kindly to those who would filch saffron from his private stores...
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2|Any news from the castle?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window|I have other things to do than to listen to a senile old man. Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.6|Yes, {playername}. Maester Theomare had a raven a few days ago, from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. We've been told to keep a watch out for wildlings, Cotter Pyke writes that they've grown ever bolder. One can only imagine, with the watch dwindled to next to nothing, and a new King-Beyond-the-Wall!
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.1|All very good, but how does that effect me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:close_window|Excuse me, I have important matters that require my attention.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.4|We haven't seen any wildlings here for years, but we haven't had visitors from Hillhall in quite a while either, though they used to come here to sell their iron. They've had a special relationship with the port officials for aeons, had dispensation granted to them by one of the old Stark lords. Cregan, I think. It's been much too long since they came here last, now that I think of it. I need you to go and take a look at the village, see if anything is wrong.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.1|I suppose I can go take a look.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window|I have better things to do than to visit some far away village. Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.1|Oh, splendid! The village lies close to the Bay of Seals, north of Karhold. Should you find anything, travel bach here and speak with Gerold, he's a recruiter for the Night's Watch, and he can take your findings back to the Wall. Along with whatever lost souls he finds in the dungeons.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window|Very well, I'll return once I've scouted the village.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.1|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.141|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk|Who are you?! Stay away from me!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2|What happened here?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.1|Wildlings, {my lord/my lady}! They come during the night, put the village to the torch! Horrible, t'was!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5|My name is {playername}. I've been sent to scout out the village. Tell me where the wildlings went.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.1|I don't know {my lord/my lady}, but they can't have gone far! Mayhaps they went for another of the villages, greedy savages that they are. Maybe Goodwife Myra over at Last Hearth have heard something, she's the biggest gossip in the realm. She works in the kitchens, along with that daughter of hers. My ma always told me kitchens are where all the important news comes through first. She should have known, worked in one for a while.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:pj_wildfire_talk8|How is it that you survived the wildling attack?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk8:close_window|I hid in the top of that huge pine over there. Saw their savagery though! T'was horrible {my lord/my lady}, horrible. Goodwife Hanna must've been raped by half a hundred men, and her daughters where made to watch, before their turn came! They're beasts in human skin these wildlings. Sleep with giants, snarks and worse.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window|Are you mad?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.1|What do you want?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.1|Have you heard of any wildlings being sighted?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.2|Oh gods no! Haven't seen a wildling since I was but a wee child. Big shaggy man he was, put an axe in the blacksmiths skull.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.1|Do you know of any who might have seen or heard anything?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.2|Talk to my daughter Jess. Foolish girl, she been talking to all kind of travellers passing through. Been laying with a few of them as well, I should think, hah. Spreading her legs for any man who wants her, she'll have a swollen belly before the years out I tell you!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:close_window|You've been most helpful.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos|Who are you?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window|I'm Goodwife Myra, the oldest woman in this here castle! Been living here for decades, I have.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.1|No matter, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.2|What do you want, huh?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.2|Careful, girl. Insolence is not a virtue.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.3|Forgive me, {my lord/my lady}. I did not see clearly who spoke to me.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk4.1|Your mother seemed to think that you may have heard about some wildlings.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk4:pj_wildfire_talk5.1|Yes, {my lord/my lady}. They come over the Wall, Willam said, though Halbert said they sail across the Bay. Then again, what do they know. Josmond said he'd heard m'lords talk about wildlings in the Lonely Hills, close to that old abandoned holdfast. Now, {my lord/my lady}, I'm sure you can tell me much more about these wildlings than any of those boys. Mayhaps you could tell me about them in the back of the barn?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.3|No. I don't lie with filthy peasants.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk7|Might be I could.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:close_window.1|Forgive me, {my lord/my lady}, is just that I saw your fancy clothing, thought you might fancy me!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk7:close_window|Oh my! Come then, take me in the barn, {my lord/my lady}!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.2|Nothing, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:order2|When you're dead, you'll join us!
; dlga_order2:order3|I don't intend to meet my end here.
; dlga_order3:close_window|I can't die! See, we're already dead! Dead, dead, dead!
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.3|What do you want? What do you want? I saw an elk carrying a dead man, in a dream!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.3|I've come searching for wildlings. Have you seen them?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.4|Saw a fist in the snow, the dead was crawling all over it! Saw a dark shape in the north! It speaks to me, whispers! Saw wild men too, but they're my brothers now! Beneath the ground we'll lie, but not yet! When the dawn is ended, I'll have my bride, my cold bride, in the snow and in the dirt!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.2|Tell me where the wildlings went. Now.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window|Hah! Heh! No! You can't have them! He gave them to me, they're mine to play with! In the cold north, the night reigns. And then they'll kill me! A big happy family we are! Come, come, I'll show you!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:nacroxnicke_creditos|Who are you?
; dlga_nacroxnicke_creditos:close_window|None of your concern! I'm just an old man!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.3|Nothing.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.4|What do you want?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.4|Septon Germund sent me.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.5|Is that so? What does the old knave want? More saffron, or is it one of Lord Manderlys nieces he's got his eye on this time? Or perhaps a cousin? Heh.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk4.2|No. He sent me to track down a band of wildlings that had burned the village of Hillhall. My journey ended north of the Dreadfort, in the Lonely Hills, where I found the wildlings. They where cold as ice, yet still they walked. Their eyes where blue, without life. They where wights.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk4:pj_wildfire_talk5.2|We had a raven from the Lord Commander... Thought for sure that Aemons wits must have been wandering, but if you saw the same in the Hills...
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.4|Hear me well, {playername}. I'm a learned man, and I've spent many of my years in the cellars of Castle Black, looking over the old books. Wights are not supposed to be able to pass beneath the Wall. It's not just ice and stone. Powerful magic was used to raise it, and it still holds to this day. These wights must have been reanimated here, not beyond the Wall.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:pj_wildfire_talk7.1|They where. I slew the man who did it.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk7:close_window.1|Gods be good! Return to Septon Germund at once, {playername}. He must be made to spread the word. The villagers must be armed. The Wall must hold!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.4|I forgot.
; dlga_start:pj_germund_talk|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_germund_talk:wildfire_espada|I found the wildlings. An old man had raised them from the dead, as wights!
; dlga_wildfire_espada:wildfire_espada2|This is dire news, {playername}! The Seven-Pointed Star warns of wights and revenants, shades and snarks! We must arm the villages, and warn the lords! And someone must send a raven to the Wall... Gueren can do that! And make sure our fires burn brigt! Speaking of fire, I have something that might come in handy, should you run into more of these creatures.
; dlga_wildfire_espada2:new_one_wildfire|Where did you get these?
; dlga_new_one_wildfire:close_window|Before I became a septon, I studied with the pyromancers of King's Landing. Old fools the lot of them! When I left them, I took these pots with me. Been a real nuisance having to transport them everywhere in barrels of sand, I tell you that! Be careful with them, they can't be refilled! And I certainly can't make any more of the substance!
; dlga_pj_germund_talk:close_window|I forgot.
; dlga_start:bye31|Greetings {playername}.
; dlga_bye31:close_window|Greetings to you too.
; dlga_start:clansman_starter_introduce_1|Yes? What do you want? Be quiet, or the young lord will be startled!. Wouldn't do to have him startled, he makes a mess when he twitches.
; dlga_clansman_starter_introduce_1:clansman_starter_introduce_2|Do you know of anyone who would happen to have a task for me?
; dlga_clansman_starter_introduce_2:close_window|The lady Lysa is the ruler of the Vale until young lord Robert comes of age. Seek an audience with her. She is currently sleeping, but come back later and I'm sure she'll find time for you.
; dlga_start:close_window.142|What?
; dlga_start:clansman_talk|Be quiet! You'll wake the baby! What do you want?
; dlga_clansman_talk:clansman_talk2|I am {playername}, my lady, and I've come seeking adventure. Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_clansman_talk:close_window|Farewell.
; dlga_clansman_talk2:clansman_talk3|Yes, {playername}, I do, I do. Those vile mountain clans have been causing all sort of chaos lately! Not three days ago, they assaulted a septa and her ward. Slew the brave knight guarding them. I wonder how they've gotten their hands on such pristine weapons... They need to be dealt with! The Vale will know what a strong and just lord they have!
; dlga_clansman_talk3:clansman_talk4|What can I do?
; dlga_clansman_talk4:clansman_talk5|Go out there and kill them, obviously! Talk to Ser Albar, Lord Nestors son. He'll know what to do, I'm sure.
; dlga_clansman_talk5:clansman_talk6|Where can I find him?
; dlga_clansman_talk6:clansman_talk7|Oh, how should I know? Do I have to do everything myself! Go look for him at the Bloody Gate, he often goes hunting there.
; dlga_clansman_talk7:close_window|Very well, I'll return once the clans have been dealt with.
; dlga_start:close_window.143|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk|I'm busy, go away!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2|Are you Ser Albar Royce?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3|Yes, what's it to you?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5|My name is {playername}. Lady Lysa sent me here, she believes you can help me dealing with the mountain clans.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6|Hah! A hundred generations of Arryns have tried to deal with those damn savages, I doubt you'll be able to do anything about them. The lady Lysa is a good and honest woman, but... she is, shall we say, prone to bouts of extreme optimism when dealing with matters like this. Still, I guess teaching the clans a lesson wouldn't be the worst we could do.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:pj_clansman_talk8|So you know where they are?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk8:close_window|Gods no! If I knew, I'd have gone after them myself. No one knows where they live, that's why they're never dealt with. The Mountains of the Moon are filled with caves and hidden valleys... Still, try and visit Jharys in Gulltown. He sometimes has dealings with the clans, but we let him get away with it because he helps us track down kidnapped maidens.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window|Hmph!
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.1|What do you want?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.1|Are you Jharys?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.1|Yes, yes, what's it to you?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5.1|Albar Royce seemed to think you might know where I could find the mountain clans.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.1|Hah, which one? There's a dozen! And no, I don't know where they are. Perhaps Ser Myles over at Coldwater Burn has heard something. That man is the biggest gossip, and drunk, in the Vale of Arryn. He knows everything.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window|You've been most helpful.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.1|No matter, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.2|What do you want, huh?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.2|Ser Myles? Jharys sent me, he told me you might know where to find the mountain clans?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.2|Oh no, haven't got a clue about them clans. Heard a juicy rumour about Mychel Redfort and Lyn Corbray recently though, and one about that singer at the lady Lysas court. Seems he's rather fond of young maidens, especially those yet to be spoiled by another man! But no, I have no idea where the mountain clans live.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk4|Do you know any who might?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5|Not really, no. Though perhaps... perhaps you could go ask my mother, lady Barbrey. She lives in Wickenden.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.2|Big help you are!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk7|Thank you, Ser Myles.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.1|Bah!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk7:close_window|Don't mention it.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.2|Nothing, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:order2.1|Grarh!
; dlga_order2:order3.1|What?
; dlga_order3:close_window.1|Die, tiny warrior!
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.3|What do you want?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.3|Lady Barbrey, your son sent me, he thinks you might know where to find the mountain clans?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.3|Bah, did he now! Could have told you himself, couldn't he? His father is the chief of one of those savage clans. Calls themselves the Moon Brothers. Bah! Guess you're done talking to me now, am I right? No one wants to talk to me ever since those savages returned me to my fathers keep, violated and big with child... Last I heard, the Moon Brothers had been seen close to Strongsong...
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5.2|Thank you.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:close_window|Nevermind...
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:nacroxnicke_creditos|May I know more about you, my lady?
; dlga_nacroxnicke_creditos:close_window.1|No! Go away, and tell that drunken bastard son of mine he's as worthless as that pig of a father who begot him!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.3|Nothing.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.4|What do you want?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.4|I've come looking for the Moon Brothers, have you heard anything?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.4|Yes, they where spotted not a mile from here! But we don't have the numbers to deal with them. As of late, the clans have grown wilder, and they bear sharp steel and heavy armor!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk4.1|I'll head out right away, and deal with them!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5.1|You'll do that now, will you?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.3|Well, I guess you might as well give it a go. I don't imagine you'll return, but here's a small parting gift. Never let it be said that the men of Strongsong don't reward bravery.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:pj_clansman_talk7|Thank you.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk7:close_window.1|My pleasure. I do hope you can do something about these savages.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.4|I forgot.
; dlga_pj_germund_talk:clansman_espada|I've slain the Moon Brothers, one less tribe of clansmen to trouble the Vale.
; dlga_clansman_espada:clansman_espada2|Trying to steal Ser Albars glory, eh? He came to me not an hour ago and told me how he and his knights had tracked down the savages and taught them who rules the Vale. I'll not have liars at the Eyrie, away with you! Just you wait till Lord Nestor hears of this!
; dlga_clansman_espada2:new_one_clansman|Erh...
; dlga_new_one_clansman:close_window|Go away!
; dlga_start:clansman_talk.1|Ah, {playername}! It's good to see you again!
; dlga_clansman_talk:clansman_talk2.1|Haldon mentioned that you might have further need of my skills.
; dlga_clansman_talk2:clansman_talk3.1|Yes, {playername}, I do, I do. I need someone to take a message to a friend of mine, in King's Landing. You know King's Landing, I assume? That big heap of fleas and poor souls strangling the mouth of the Blackwater Rush. Can't miss it, and even if you do, the smell will remind you that you're close.
; dlga_clansman_talk3:clansman_talk4.1|Where can I find him?
; dlga_clansman_talk3:close_window|Excuse me, I have important matters that require my attention.
; dlga_clansman_talk4:clansman_talk5.1|Oh, he's usually to be found in the Black Cells of the Red Keep. Outside them though, not inside. Works as an undergaoler in the cells.
; dlga_clansman_talk5:clansman_talk6.1|What is his name? How do I know whether I'm talking to the right person?
; dlga_clansman_talk5:close_window|On second thought, I think I'll stay out of this.
; dlga_clansman_talk6:clansman_talk7.1|My friend goes by the name of Rugen. I suppose he'll be dressed as a gaoler. Gaolers usually are. Helps mark them for what they are, that is. Gaolers, nothing else. How could a man dressed as a gaoler be anything but a gaoler.
; dlga_clansman_talk7:close_window.1|Very well, I'll bring Rugen your message.
; dlga_clansman_talk7:close_window.2|I can't carry that right now.
; dlga_start:close_window.144|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.5|Yes?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.5|Are you Rugen?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5.3|My name is {playername}. I've been sent by Illyrio Mopatis, all the way from Pentos, to bring you a message.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.4|Ah, yes, the message. Hmph, well done {playername}. Let's keep this between us, eh? Here's a bit of... ah... incentive.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:pj_clansman_talk8.1|Do you need me to bring back a message?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk8:pj_clansman_talk9|Well, ah, if you're headed back to Pentos, you might as well bring him my, ah, reply. You'll need to keep quiet about your doings, obviously.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk9:close_window|Very well.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk9:close_window.1|I can't carry that right now.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.6|Yes {playername}?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.6|Rugen asked me bring you his reply.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.5|Ah splendid, {playername}. You've been a great help. Would you be interested in doing me yet another favor?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5.4|Yes.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.5|I need you to bring a chest of... valuables... to an acquaintance of mine. A knight, by the name of Rolly Duckfield. I've arranged for him to wait in a tavern in Norvos. Bring him the chest, and I'll make sure you're well rewarded.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.2|Very well.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.3|I can't carry that right now.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.5|No matter, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.7|What do you want, huh?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.7|Ser Rolly? Magister Illyrio asked me to bring you this chest.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.6|Ah good, good. But Griff says our plans have changed, and I'm afraid I can't carry this with me if we're going to get the boy to Selhorys in time. You'll need to return this to Magister Illyrio, with my apologies.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk4.2|Who are you talking about? Take it back?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5.2|Ah shit. Nevermind. Just bring the chest back to Pentos, and talk with the fat man. Tell him we're heading west instead of east.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.6|I'm not a pack mule!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk7.1|Very well.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.4|Bah!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk7:close_window.2|Thanks, friend.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.6|Nothing, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.8|Yes, {playername}? How very good to see you. Did you get the chest to Norvos?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.8|I did, but your friend had me bring it back here.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.7|What? Why? Did he give you a reason. Speak man.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5.5|He said something about a boy, Selhorys and going west?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.7|Curse that man! Griff is too impatient! We've been keeping him secret for sixteen years, and now we're running out of time?! We'll have to act quickly, {playername}. Go back to King's Landing and tell Rugen what you've learned. No, better yet, bring him this letter.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.5|Very well.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.6|I'm afraid I can't carry a letter right now.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.7|Nothing.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.9|What do you want?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.9|I'm looking for a man named Rugen.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.8|Ah, Rugen! An unsavory fellow. Not like myself. I'm of royal blood myself, you see.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk4.3|What are you talking about?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5.3|I'm descended from the natural born son of a Targaryen princess. My mother told me the story. My ancestor was such a strong, brave and handsome warrior, that even a princess could fall in love with him. She told me he was a captain of a ship, a man who braved even the storms of the Cape of Wrath.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.8|Their son was born a bastard, but a royal bastard! My fathers father added the 'Long' before 'Waters'. We're a noble family of knights carrying royal blood, you see. Couldn't have a name as lowborn as 'Waters'!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:pj_clansman_talk7.1|Oh, I don't care! Do you know where Rugen is?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk7:close_window.3|He's in the tavern. I swear it on my royal blood!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.8|I forgot.
; dlga_start:pj_germund_talk.1|Ah, {playername}.
; dlga_pj_germund_talk:clansman_espada.1|Magister Illyrio asked me to deliver this letter to you.
; dlga_clansman_espada:clansman_espada2.1|Well, ah, then. Give it here.
; dlga_clansman_espada2:new_one_clansman.1|Well?
; dlga_new_one_clansman:new_one_clansman2|I am in your debt, {playername}. Here, please accept this gift as a sign of my gratitude.
; dlga_new_one_clansman2:new_one_clansman3|If you don't mind me asking, who is Griff?
; dlga_new_one_clansman3:doran_martell_quest|Ah, {playername}, you'll know in time, in time. Suffice to say, the men of the Sunset Kingdoms are all the same. They sew some beast upon a scrap of silk, and suddenly they are all lions or stags or eagles, but black or red, a dragon is still a dragon. But ah, I need you to do one last thing for me...
; dlga_doran_martell_quest:doran_martell_quest1|I need you to visit a winesink in Sunspear, called the Thirsty Goat. Look for a man called Septon Allard, and deliver the letter to him.
; dlga_doran_martell_quest1:close_window|Very well.
; dlga_pj_germund_talk:close_window.1|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.10|What?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.10|I bring a sealed letter from Rugen.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.9|Do you now... give it to me.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk4.4|Here you are.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5.4|Hmm...
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.9|The prince must hear of this. Visit the castle and deliver this letter to Maester Caleotte.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:pj_clansman_talk7.2|Erm, I will...
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.7|I can't carry that right now.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk7:close_window.4|Good.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.9|I forgot.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.11|Yes?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.11|I was told to bring you this.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.10|Ah yes... {playername}, Magister Illyrio speaks highly of you in this letter, you've done the prince a great service.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk4.5|I'm glad.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5.5|Hmm...
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.10|It seems to me that the magister did not offer you a suitable reward for the great risks you've faced... I will make sure you receive a proper reward, on the understanding that not a word of what you've accomplished for us ever leave your mouth... Words are like arrows, once loosened you cannot call them back, and one stray arrow can bring down even a prince.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:pj_clansman_talk7.3|I won't speak a word of what I've done.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk7:close_window.5|Good, good. Accept this as a proper reward for your accomplishments then, {playername}, and remember your vow. The storm is on the horizon.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.10|I forgot.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.1|Yes, can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.1|I'm looking for the castellan, have you seen him?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.1|Ser Rodrik rode into the woods this morning, but he should be back soon.
; dlga_start:close_window.145|Excuse me, I'm very busy.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.1|Welcome to Winterfell. Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.1|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.1|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.7|Yes, I do. If you're man enough for it.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.2|What would you have me do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.5|The Bastard of Bolton has been wrecking havock across the Lonely Hills. For his crimes, he has been sentenced to death. I need someone who can bring the kings justice to this monster of a man.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.2|Hmm... Is there a reward for this task?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.1|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.2|Indeed there is. Bring about the Bastards demise, and I will grant you a fair reward.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.2|Very well, I will bring the kings justice to Ramsay Snow.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.3|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.146|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.5|What do you want? Leave me be, peasant, I have no time for beggars.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.5|Ramsay Snow, by order of ser Rodrik Cassel, castellan of Winterfell, I sentence you to die.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.6|What? I'll teach you to call me 'Snow'! Do you truly think you can harm me here, in my lord fathers castle?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.3|No, but you will have to leave eventually. When you do, you die.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.1|Maybe it'll be you choking on your own blood! I will hurt you, I will flay you, and when I am done with you, you'll beg for death!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.5|Hmph!
; dlga_start:order2.2|I'll flay the skin off your wretched body!
; dlga_order2:order3.2|We'll see about that!
; dlga_order3:close_window.2|I'll make you regret this!
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.6|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.6|Ser Rodrik, I've taken care of the Bastard for you. He shouldn't be a threat any longer.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.7|Truly? Winterfell and the North is in your debt, {playername}. Ramsay Snow was not a man, he was a beast wearing a mans skin. I'll see to it that you'll be rewarded for this deed.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window|My pleasure, Ser Rodrik. If you've any other tasks that need doing, please let me know.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.1|May I know more about you?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.1|I am Rodrik Cassel, castellan and master-at-arms at Winterfell.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.6|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.2|I am Septon Garibald. May the Father Above watch over you. Now, how can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.2|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:wildfire_starter_introduce_3|No, not right now, but I've heard that one of the tenants of Cairnhall has been seeking a knight to get rid of an, erm, wight... or a grumkin. Who can tell what goes on in a peasants mind. He has made his home in the tavern. I also overheard Lord Swanns captain of the guards, Ser Clifford Gower, talk about some letters he needs delivered to some minor lord. Ser Clifford went out hunting this morning, but he should be back in a few hours. Ah, and yes, if you have the time, {playername}, I need a letter delivered to archmaester Harodon at the Citadel in Oldtown.
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_3:close_window|Very well.
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_3:close_window.1|I can't carry a letter right now.
; dlga_start:close_window.147|I'm busy.
; dlga_start:bank_pretalk|Welcome to the Iron Bank. How can I be of service?
; dlga_bank_pre_pretalk:bank_pretalk|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_bank_pretalk:bank_talk|I want to discuss my finances.
; dlga_bank_pretalk:close_window|Farewell.
; dlga_bank_talk:bank_talk_1|Very well. You do not yet have an account with us. We will gladly help you deposit whatever amount of coin you desire here with us. You can retrieve your gold whenever you so desire, and we are currently offering a 5% return rate on deposits. Is that acceptable?

; dlga_bank_talk_3:bank_pre_pretalk|Never mind.
; dlga_bank_talk_1:bank_talk_zalozenie|That is acceptable.
; dlga_bank_talk_1:bank_pre_pretalk|That is all I wanted to know.
; dlga_bank_talk_zalozenie:bank_pretalk|Very well. Welcome to the Iron Bank of Braavos.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.2|What is it? I'm busy! All these acolytes, with their stupid questions!
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.2|Archmaester Harodon? Septon Garibald told me to deliver this letter to you.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.2|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.8|Oh who cares. Another septon, preaching to us about how our efforts are futile, that all truth lies with the Father Above. Bah! Bunch of sheep is what they are!
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.3|What do you mean?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.6|The Faith has been trying to curb our influence for hundreds of years. Feel like they should be the only ones spreading knowledge. Or their version of it, at least. Sheep is what they are, shackled in their huts of ignorance. Did you know that Baelor the Blessed was considering a request to bring the Citadel under the authority of the High Septon when he died? Good thing his uncle killed him, Viserys was a much better king. Didn't know that, did you? Oh, there's no written evidence, but sure as rain, Viserys murdered Baelor and took the throne.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.3|Very well...
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.3|Do you believe in the Seven, {playername}? That the Father Above watches you, the Warrior protects you, the Crone lights the way?
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.1|I do.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk9|I do not.
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window|Then to you I say 'bahhh'. Go rut around in the mud with the other sheep, and leave us enlightened men to continue our work.
; dlga_wildfire_talk9:close_window|Ah, a learned men is what you are then. Well done I say. Too many superstitious fools rut around in the mud, always looking for answers they'll never find. Marwyn could tell you all about what it's like to rut around down there.
; dlga_start:close_window.148|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.3|Yes? How can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.3|Who are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.3|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.9|An Archmaester of the Citadel! Though there's plenty of us around, these days the conclave will give any man who's read a book the title. Just look at Harodon. Bigger fool you'd have to search for far and wide. The Faith can be niggardly, stubborn, backwards and cruel, but the septons still hold more power than we'll ever do, advisers of lords and ladies though we are. It's unwise to antagonize those with more power than yourself.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk5.1|You won't hear me defend the septons though. They've burned more books than I care to think about. Imagine what we would know of the past, if it wasn't for Baelor Targaryen. All those books, gone, and for what? Some silly king, half a boy, who fancied himself more than a man, more than a king. Baelor saw himself as the embodiement of the Seven, a god made flesh.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.4|Very well...
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.4|It's all here in the books. The evidence. You just have to look for it. Plenty of people don't. They'll read some asinine book meant for bored lords and ladies, and think they understand the way the world works. But without proper training, how will they ever be able to see the world for what is really is. Bah, nothing worse than some uneducated know-it-all. But ah, enough of the rabble. More important things are afoot in the world. Did you know that the Citadel is always looking for lost works? Books, scrolls, ledgers. Would you be interested in procuring such items for us, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.2|I am interested.
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.1|Ah, good. Books are precious, you know. A single copy of Barths 'Unnatural History' would be worth more than a sword of valyrian steel. Imagine that, {playername}! Alas, Baelor was thorough in destroying all of Barths writings. But enough about that. If you want to help us conserve the knowledge of the past, travel to King's Landing. The Citadel employs a procurer in the city, who always scours the bookshops for unknown writings, but he often needs men who can travel further from the city and pick up books from other places. His name is Malko, you can find him on Coppersmith's Wynd. He runs a shop called 'Malkos Bookstore'. No one ever required the man to have a bit of imagination, but still...
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.4|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.149|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.4|Ah, a customer! How can I help you, my good man?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.4|I've been sent by Archmaester Harodon.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.4|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.10|Joyous news! My last procurer had a nasty accident a couple of months back. Cut himself on a fine piece of vellum, and would you believe it, it turned gangrenous! Lost his whole hand. Sad story, so sad. At least it wasn't his right hand, he'll still be able to work as a scribe... 
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.4|What does a procurer do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.7|They procure books. I have many contacts throughout the Seven Kingdoms, and you wouldn't believe the kind of lost knowledge the lords and knights of the realm have hidden away in their cellars. Once, I found a piece of Septon Barth's 'Dragons, Wyrms and Wyverns: Their Unnatural History' being used as a tablecloth in the room of an old blind knight. Sold it to Tyrion Lannister for a king's ransom. Even the Citadel itself cannot outbid a Lannister. But they are my most persistent customers, the maesters.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.5|But what do you need me for?
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.5|I can't leave my shop to go gallivanting around the world looking for books, but I can't send a soft scribe in my place either. Even at the best of times, the roads can be hazardous. But you look like a tough sort, and I have work for someone tough. I've heard rumours of a book, hidden away in the Vale. It might be multiple books to tell you the truth. It's referenced in various texts, most notably in one of Barth's fragments. It goes by different names. The Dreams of Azathoth. Dead Names. But it's most often called The Mysteries of the Worm. Who knows which one is real. I think it's a myth, but imagine if not! We could sell the book to the maesters for unimaginable riches!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.3|It's very valuable?
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.2|Ah, not really. Marwyn writes that the people of Asshai tell tales of the book. It's supposed to be an introduction to all kinds of magic. Silly superstitions. But the maesters have labored long and hard to eradicate supposed 'magical' textbooks, and a find such as this could render many of their efforts futile. So they'd pay well to have it destroyed. According to my sources, a septon has been making mentions of a magical book in the north-western parts of the Vale. Go there and talk to him, {playername}, find out if there's any truth to the whole thing. I'll reward you handsomely, and here's a bit of an advance.
; dlga_start:close_window.150|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.5|A blessing, my good man? The Father Above is all the protection you need. Lay down your weapons and rejoice in his holy light.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.5|I'm looking for a book.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.5|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.11|What book?...
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.5|The Mysteries of the Worm?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.8|Never heard of it. Only book a godly man need is The Seven-Pointed Star. Everything else is just worldly knowledge, soon to be forgotten. Why waste your time with books about plants when you could show your devotion to the Seven instead?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.6|So you haven't heard anything about a book? It's supposed to be rare.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.6|Haven't heard anything about much lately. This is a remote corner of the world, my little place of worship. The smallfolk around here are simple, with simple needs and simple dreams.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.4|Do you know anyone who might have knowledge of books in the area?
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.3|Can't say I do. Though perhaps Ser Elston have heard something. His holdings are to the east of here, close to the foot of the mountains. We're very isolated here, but if anyone have heard anything about books, it's either Ser Elston or his maester.
; dlga_start:close_window.151|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.6|Terrible weather, isn't it? It feels... sour. Somethings wrong with it.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.6|What do you mean?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.6|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.12|This whole place is... wrong. Should have stayed on the road. Never wanted this. I'm Ser Elston Boone, the last of House Boone. Inherited these holdings from a distant cousin last year. Used to be a tourney knight. What a life, riding from town to town, not a care in the world. Now I'm shackled to this place.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.6|I'm looking for a rare book, and was wondering if I might consult with your maester?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.9|The Mysteries of the Worm? I can see from your reaction that's the one. Cadwyn has not been talking about anything else for weeks. Found it mentioned in some old papers left behind by one of my ancestors. Mentioned something about Witch Isle and the Upcliffs. Cadwyn was sure he could figure out where the book went... Did you hear that?! There's something in the walls. Perhaps it's just rats... but they'd have to be a monstrous size...
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.7|Can I talk to maester Cadwyn?
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.7|Afraid not, {playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.5|Why not?
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.4|He killed himself. Two days ago. Cut his own throat. Bad way to go. It's this sour air. It turns everyone mad. He rambled for days you know. Shouting about the Long Night. About great white spiders and wights walking up and down a wall... his trip to the barrow changed him... should never visit barrows, {playername}, the dead sleep better when not disturbed...
; dlga_start:close_window.152|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.7|Ah, {playername}! Tell me, did you find the book?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.7|I did not.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.7|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.13|Oh, what a shame. Just a rumor then, nothing to it? I hear all kinds of stories, most of them untrue. You wouldn't believe the nonsense tales that originate in remote hamlets.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.7|I did hear of a fragment of the book.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.10|You did? Tell me more!
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.8|A maester found a clue or a sliver of notes partaining to it. I tried to find where it was, but all I found was a crazed man who had sacrificed to an old tree. He'd written the name 'YGG' on a stone, with the blood of one of his victims.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.8|'Ygg', you say? How quaint. The ironborn tell tales of how their legendary ruler, The Grey King, carved the first longship from a tree called Ygg. Supposively, a demon lived in the tree, a demon with the power of foresight. Anyone who had their future told by Ygg would inevitable meet with tragedy. Ygg always chose to tell the future in a way that would cause the most pain to the world.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.6|Is the story true?
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.5|Ah, not really. How could it be. A demon living in a tree? Sounds like the maester you mentioned got caught up in some fancy tale of his own. But forget about that, {playername}. At least you tried to find the book. That's worth a reward.
; dlga_start:close_window.153|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.8|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.8|Ser Clifford? Septon Garibald told me you had need of someone to deliver a letter?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.8|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.14|Ah yes, I do. The maiden daughter of Symond Templeton, the Knight of Ninestars, is turning thirteen this next moon, and Ser Symonds uncles have decided to hold a tourney in her honor. My late wife was a Templeton by birth, making the young girl my niece by marriage. I've been invited to attend the melee, but my duties keep me here. However, I was always fond of my lady wife, and for her sake, I wish to send a name day present to the young girl.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.8|What can I do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.11|Take this letter, and this ruby ring which belonged to my lady wife, and deliver them to the castellan of Ninestars, he'll make sure the young maid receives them. Be mindful, however, that you do not upset her uncles - they're a querulous bunch. I'll make sure you're compensated for your troubles, {playername}, obviously.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.9|Very well, I'll do it.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.2|I'm afraid I can't carry all that now.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.9|Splendid! With all the chaos engulfing the realm, I imagine this will be the last great tourney in quite a while. While you're in the Vale, you should take the time to enjoy yourself. This summer has lasted a long time already, there's no knowing how much time we have left before winter arrives and we all have to huddle around our fires.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.5|Very well, I'll take a look at the tourney while I'm there.
; dlga_start:close_window.154|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.9|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.9|My lord? I'm looking for the castellan. I've brought a gift and letter from Ser Clifford Gower.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.15|Oh well, I'm the castellan of Ninestars, so you've found your man. Ser Clifford you say? By the Seven, we haven't heard from him in years. How is the old rogue doing? Oh, nevermind, how would you know. You said something about a gift? And a letter? I doubt Rowena can even remember Ser Clifford, not with all those great-uncles of hers taking up all her time and attention. Ser Symonds father had seven brothers, can you believe that?! Boisterous and arrogant the lot of them.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.9|Here's the letter and the gift.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.12|Ah, thank you {playername}, I do appreciate it. The young lady will surely enjoy this gift, the ring is an old family heirloom. I'll make sure she receives them right away. Say, while you're here, you should take a stroll around the grounds. A great many merchants and mummers have camped outside the walls, and they're sure to provide a great spectacle and much merriment.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.10|I'll do that.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.10|Good, good. Do stay around for the tourney, will you? We haven't had as many visitors as we hoped. The mountain clans have grown wild, and many knights and lords have decided to stay in their keeps and holdfasts, rather than risking the roads. It was different when Jon Arryn ruled the Vale, then those vile savages wouldn't have dared show their face unless they had ten times the numbers we do!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.6|Very well, I'll take a look at the tourney while I'm there.
; dlga_start:close_window.155|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.10|{playername}. What where you thinking? The knight you attacked is Ser Raymun Templeton, Ser Symonds youngest uncle. What a mess, the man is infuriated. Let me ask you this, {playername}, how good of a fighter are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.10|I can hold my own.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.16|Doesn't say much, does it? What a vague answer. You're a guest here, {playername}, and an unknown one at that. You struck a relative of the Knight of Ninestars, outside his own castle. Ser Symond would be in his right to cut off the offending hand. But Ser Raymun was never his favorite uncle, nor is he a friend of mine, so it's been agreed that you will be judged by someone other than Ser Symond. As it happens, I will be one of the three judges at your trial.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.10|Then why are you here?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.13|Why indeed. Ser Raymun and I have never been fast friends. To tell you the truth, I despise the man. However, the other two judges are his brothers. I'm the castellan of Ninestars, and a knight of House Tollett, my word carries weight in these parts, and I will urge the judges to be merciful. However, you struck the youngest brother of the two other judges, so there's a risk you'll wake up tommorow without a hand. There is another option, though.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.11|Tell me.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.11|You stand accused of assaulting a relative of the Knight of Ninestars. The judges will be unlikely to look upon your case with favorable eyes. But if you demand a trial by combat, you might be able to prevail. So I ask you again, {playername}, how good of a warrior are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.7|I see.
; dlga_start:close_window.156|Sleep on it, {playername}, the trial starts tommorow.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.11|{playername}! Hah! Did you see the look on Raymuns face? That bastard got a surprise there, no denying it. But can you defeat him? I admit, I know nothing about you, except for your ability to hit knights right on the nose. Are you a knight yourself?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.11|Yes.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2_no|No.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.17|Oh well, that makes everything so much easier. A knight! Really? Splendid. Do you have own armor? Sword, helmet, horse? Ah well, either way, I would be honored if you'd let me provide all you need. {playername}, during the trial, did you notice how some of the knights and ladies seemed to approve of your request? Ser Raymun is not well loved, and there's been stories... peasant girls have complained before... either way, I think that not only the smallfolk but a great part of the nobles will be on your side during this fight. Why, you ask? Well, a knight is sworn to protect the weak. You remembered those vows.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2_no:wildfire_talk3|Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter. Do you have own armor? Sword, helmet, horse? Ah well, either way, I would be honored if you'd let me provide all you need. {playername}, during the trial, did you notice how some of the knights and ladies seemed to approve of your request? Ser Raymun is not well loved, and there's been stories... peasant girls have complained before... either way, I think that not only the smallfolk but a great part of the nobles will be on your side during this fight.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.11|I suppose so.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.14|Do you know the rules of trial by combat, {playername}? The fight ends when either party yields or is killed, or when the accuser takes back his accusation, or when the accused declares himself guilty. You'll need to either kill Ser Raymun, or force him to yield and withdraw his accusations.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.12|Very well.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.12|I don't imagine there's much more to say. The trial is tommorow, I suggest you get some sleep. Ser Raymun was never a great warrior, but he's not unskilled either.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.8|I see.
; dlga_start:close_window.157|Sleep on it, {playername}, the trial starts tommorow.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.12|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.12|Are you from Cairnhall?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.9|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.18|Ah yes, yes, I am Tom, the Elder sent me here to find a knight, true and honorable!
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.12|Erm, yes... Septon Garibald said you'd been having problems with a... wight?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.15|Yes, yes, a revenant, a wight, a ghost! Saw it myself, only three weeks ago! Pale and with red eyes, it was flying through the night, in a crate made of bones! Made me shiver, make no mistake! The men of the village agreed with me, we need an faithful man to slay the beast, a knight, like Aemon the Dragonknight, from the stories!
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.13|Hmm... perhaps I could take a look at this wight myself.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.3|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.13|Are you a knight? Oh, I'm sorry, of course you are! My father always told me the city was full of knights! Go to my village and slay the revenant, brave Ser! It haunts the old cairn, sure as day!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.9|Very well, I'll go have a look.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.10|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.158|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.7|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.7|Have you seen a wight about here?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.7|Hmph!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.8|By the Seven, another one? Look, I'm not a wight, as I tried to tell that screaming girl when she came up here. I've been sent here by the Citadel to do some excavating, and I'll be gone in a day or two. This cairn really is a marvelous treasure trove. Found a cache of scrolls from before the Conquest, and tablets speaking of the Battle of the Bloody Pool.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.4|You seem to have caused quite a stir in the village. Why didn't you just explain to them what you where doing here.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.2|Ah, but then I'd have to explain to them what 'excavating' means, and before you know it, they're coming to me to bless their cows, heal their wounds and wed their daughters. Keep ignorant peasants away from me, and I can die a happy man.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.8|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.8|Tom, I've taken care of the... wight.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.9|Truly? Well done, Ser! I knew a true knight would have no trouble dealing with such a demon! Any man who is shrouded in his faith can withstand such a beast, the septon was right! Here, please take this, as a thank you!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.1|Thank you, Tom.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.2|Can you tell me more about Cairnhall?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.2|Well... we grow a lot of beets... turnips too, now that I think about it.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.8|Nevermind.
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.3|Who are you?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.2|I'm here to forge my chain and become grandmaester... Say, are you looking for work? Maester Yandel said he was looking for a courier.
; dlga_start:close_window.159|What?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.13|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.13|Are you Yandel?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.10|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.19|Ah yes, yes, I am Yandel. Who are you, and how can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.13|One of the acolytes said you where looking for a courier?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.16|Ah yes, quite, quite. I do. I have been working on a momentous tome these past years. I call it 'The World of Ice and Fire'. Beautiful work. Dedicated to king Robert, but now I suppose it should be dedicated to his heir... Either way, some of the illuminators in Lannisport have been working on a copy for the king. They do great work there, letters in gold and scarlet like you wouldn't believe. And I especially enjoy their work on sigils, it's like the krakens are getting ready to strangle the reader!
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.14|And?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.4|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.14|Ah, I need someone to pick it up and deliver it to me. They're excellent craftsmen in Lannisport, but before I have the tome delivered to the king, I should like to check it for spelling errors. Wouldn't do to let the king be disappointed! And to tell you the truth, I quite enjoy looking at the pictures. Can you pick up the book? I'd do it myself, but I can't bear to be gone from the archives for long. So many mysteries! I'll make sure you're rewarded for your troubles.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.11|Very well, I'll go get the tome.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.12|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.160|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.9|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.9|I'm here to pick up a tome for Maester Yandel.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.9|Hmph!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.10|Ah yes, very good. The ink finished drying not three days ago. It's quite beautiful, and I'm sure the king will be pleased. We used the same scarlet as the one Lord Tywin had us use for his invitation to the wedding of the king and queen, Lannister colors you know. That will be 500 coins for the work we've done. The Citadel has already paid for the materials.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.5|Very well.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.3|Here we are! The finest book ever made, I'd say. I had a look through it while the apprentices worked. The craftsmanship is like nothing anyones ever seen before, but you must give my regards to Yandel. The text is quite interesting as well.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.2|I can't afford that.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.10|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.10|I've returned with the tome.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.11|Ah, very well. Yes, this is beautiful work indeed. Those apprentices know what they're about. Look at those dragons, it's almost as if you can feel the heat coming off them. Here's a little recompense for your troubles, {playername}.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.3|Thank you.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.10|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.3|Well met, {playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.4|How do you know my name?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.3|I am Gueren, a brother of the Night's Watch. Gerold told me about you, {playername}, and how you handled that mad bastard up in the old holdfast. The latest raven from Aemon told of troubles at the Wall, perhaps you could head up there and see what's going on. Or maybe take the black yourself, the Wall is not picky.
; dlga_start:close_window.161|The Wall must not fall, {playername}.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.14|Yes? Who is it? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.14|Maester Aemon? Gueren said you'd been having some sort of trouble lately?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.11|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.20|Ah, Gueren. Troubles he says. We're in dire need of help, {playername}. Lord Commander Mormont went north with near a third of our strength. Only a few have returned. The Watch is sorely weakened, and the realm is disunited and in chaos. We can expect no help from any of the kings.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.14|How can I help?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.17|One of our brothers, Jon, recently returned to us. He had been pretending to join the wildlings, and he has brought us valuable information of their whereabouts and intentions. Jon left the wildlings just south of Mole's Town, and we have every reason to believe they might still be somewhere in the area. Jon says they're led by a man named Styr, the Magnar of Thenn. Magnar means 'lord' in the Old Tongue, but even a lord amongst the wildlings will want to loot and burn a town such as Mole's Town.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.15|Hmm... what do you want me to do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.5|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.15|We have assembled a force of men to intercept the Magnar and defeat his band of raiders, but Bowen Marsh has gone west to defend the Shadow Tower with the remaining part of the garrison, and we need someone to led them. Jon is still too weak to leave his bed, and Donal Noye must stay here to led the defenses. The rest of our brothers are eager, but they do not have the experience. Gerold mentioned your deeds in the Lonely Hills, and I trust his judgement. You must led the brothers of the Night's Watch against the Magnar, {playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.13|Very well, I will defeat the Magnar!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.14|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.162|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.11|Yes, {playername}? Is the Magnar dead? 
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.11|The Magnar is dead.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.12|Truly? This is joyous news, {playername}. You have bought us valuable time to arm ourselves against attack. While we prepare for the inevitable, I need someone to visit Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and tell Cotter Pyke of the events here. Will you do this?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.4|I will, Maester Aemon.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.3|May I know more about you?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.3|Ah, {playername}, there is much and more to know, but none left to tell my story. Egg is long gone...
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.11|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.15|Yes? Who are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.15|Maester Aemon sent me, with news from Castle Black.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.21|Well, out with it then. I'm not some pampered knight, I feel no need to waste time with idle yammering.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.15|The wildlings are approaching the wall. We stopped them in Mole's Town.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.18|Well then, I guess we're saved for another day, eh? I don't see why Aemon couldn't send a raven with these news. Why are you here? Ah, I see. He wants me to send my men to Castle Black, to defend it against the attack? Just because that fool, Bowen Marsh, had to gallavant off to defend against an obvious diversion! Fine! Tell Aemon I'll send as many men as I can spare, I'll even send Emmett with them. The lads worth three experienced rangers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.16|Very well, I'll return to Aemon with these news.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.6|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.16|Good! And tell Bowen he's a fool while you're at it!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.15|Erh, yes...
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.16|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.163|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.12|Farewell.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.12|Yes, {playername}? What did Cotter Pyke say? 
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.12|He's sending as many men as he can spare to aid us in the defense.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.13|Good, good. It probably helps that Bowen is absent, he can't stand the man... {playername}, I need you to travel to the Shadow Tower, and visit Ser Denys, and see what has happened to Bowen Marsh and his men. They've been gone for a long time, and the men of the Shadow Tower can guard the Gorge as well as the men of Castle Black. We need them here, to defend the Wall against Mance Rayder.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.5|Very well.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.4|Can you tell me about Castle Black?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.4|Ah, {playername}, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me. Perhaps you could ask Clydas...
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.12|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.16|Yes? Who are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.16|Maester Aemon sent me, for news of Bowen Marsh.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.22|Ah, very well. But you're not my brother, are you? Ah, no matter, no matter, we need all the help we can get. Lord Marsh was well the last time I saw him, {playername}. He took most of my men to the Gorge, to guard the Bridge of Skulls.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.16|The Bridge of Skulls?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.19|Ah, you haven't heard of it. The Bridge is the only way across the Gorge, a large, well, gorge, very deep. The wildlings often descend the Gorge, to bypass the Wall. We'd had news that a large force of wildlings where in the area, so Lord Marsh took the greater part of our strength to defend the Bridge.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.17|Cotter Pyke said Bowen Marsh was a fool for falling for the diversion?...
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.7|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.17|Cotter Pyke! Bah! The bastard son of a tavern wench, the most vile man in the entire Watch, an ironborn bastard, half a wildling himself! Still, I myself might not have been so quick to take the greater part of our strength with me to guard the Gorge... Ah, nothing to do about it now. In fact, {playername}, I'd greatly appreciate it if you where to head to the Gorge yourself. Should the wildlings attack, Lord Marsh could use all the help he can get!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.17|I'll have a look at this Gorge!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.18|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.164|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.13|Farewell.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.13|Yes, {playername}? How fares Lord Marsh? 
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.13|The Weeper tried to force his away across, but we beat him back.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.14|Good, good, {playername}. But the wildlings are sure to descend on Castle Black at any moment now, you must hurry back and lend whatever aid you can. The Wall has stood for eight thousand years, we'll make sure it still stands after this King-Beyond-the-Wall is in his grave.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.6|Very well, Ser Denys.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.5|Can you tell me about the Shadow Tower?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.5|Ah, {playername}, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me, Maester Mullin is the scholar here.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.13|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.17|{playername}. Is Bowen still alive?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.17|Barely, Maester Aemon. What happened here?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.23|Another party of wildlings attacked us, but we beat them back. Alas, the true battle has only just begun, {playername}. They have been digging throuhg the Wall, and they've managed to make a breach into one of the storerooms. The lower part of the wall is vulnerable in a very few places, if it had been anyone but Mance Rayder leading them, they would have never known where to dig.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.17|What can I do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.20|Join the fight, {playername}. The stewards are holding the wall, raining down arrows on the wildlings. Jon has taken the remaining rangers and are holding off the wildlings in the tunnels beneath the Wall. Join him and defend the realm, {playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.18|Where is the breach?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.8|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.18|Just west of here. Make haste!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.19|For the realm!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.20|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.165|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.14|Farewell.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.18|Yes? Ah, {playername}. What news do you bring?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.18|We beat back the wildlings.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.24|Ah, very well. But I fear our position is untenable. It would have been different if the Watch had been at full strength, but our forces have dwindled over the years... we face a position unlike any in our long history.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.18|What do you mean?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.21|Time and time again, the wildlings have thrown themselves against the Wall. Raymund Redbeard, Bael the Bard, Joramun... but this time, it is different. We are a shadow of our former selves, and the Stark in Winterfell has gone south. There is no one to defeat the wildlings when they make their final attack on the Wall.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.19|But we beat them back in the tunnels!
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.9|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.19|A test, {playername}. Mance Rayder has men to spare, and we have none. We cannot hold them off, but we can continue the fight! You must go to Jon and tell him to evacuate Castle Black. A Lord Commander could never do so, but Lord Mormont is gone, and we've yet to chose a successor. I can order the brothers to go south, and join the northern lords in their holdfasts and castles. We have no commanding officers, and I am the oldest brother of the Night's Watch still alive. The high lords cannot accuse me of cowardice, no sane man would wish to live to my age.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.7|But ah, before you go... a gift. When I joined the Order of Maesters, I forswore my old family name, but I have not forgotten it. When Bloodraven left for his last ranging, he entrusted me with the sword his father bestowed upon him. The sword that Aegon's sister Visenya wielded when she rode upon Meraxes, one of the three great dragons. The ancestral valyrian sword of House Targaryen! It is called Dark Sister, and its history is illustrious and proud. You must wield it now, {playername}, and defend the realm, as the kings should have.
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.6|I am honored, my lord.
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.7|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.166|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.15|Farewell.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.14|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.14|Aemon has ordered you to abandon the Wall.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.15|We're sworn to guard the realm! There’s no shame in fear, my father told me, what matters is how we face it... Arh, Maester Aemon has the right of it! We could throw away our lives here, and it would barely slow down Mance and his army! We'll retreat to Winterfell, and join the lords when they march on the wildlings.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.7|For the realm!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.6|Can we hold the Wall?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.6|We're sworn to hold the Wall.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.14|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.4|Yes? Another adventurer, come to our great city, eh? Looking for valyrian steel?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.5|Tell me more.
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.4|The best craftman in the city is Elos Mott. He's the master of the Guild of Blacksmiths. If you're interested in valyrian steel, talk to him.
; dlga_start:close_window.167|Good luck.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.19|Yes? I am Elos Mott, leader of the Blachsmiths of Qohor, most gifted of all the craftsmen in the world. Welcome to my shop.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.19|Cetherys said you could tell me about valyrian steel?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.16|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.25|Ah, the bane of my existence! Everyone wants to know about valyrian steel. Why, I ask, when one could also learn about tinted metals, armor strong enough to withstand the blow of a warhammer, or even the precious substance the alchemists call wildfire. But no! Always valyrian steel... travellers and adventurers, princes and archons, they all come asking about the steel of Valyria.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.19|What would you have me tell you, that no one does not already know. Valyrian steel is precious. A drunk in a tavern could tell you that. Valyrian steel is indestructable. The same drunk would tell you the same truth. Valyrian steel is the rarest material in the world, worth lordships and fiefdoms. All the drunks in the world know this.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.22|But can I, the master of blacksmiths, reforge valyrian steel? Yes. I can. Can I make new valyrian steel. Well... time will soon tell. Remember the fate of Maester Pol, and do not inquire into my work, or the work of my colleagues. The city watch will have you if you do, and so will the disciples of the Black Goat.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.20|But you can reforge valyrian steel?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.10|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.20|Yes, I can. Any member of the guild can. However, we do not provide the steel. Even if we had such materials at hand, Tywin Lannister has already paid us good, solid, gold to reserve it for him. No, {playername}, I will gladly reforge a blade for you, but you will need to gather the materials yourself. We once forged a new blade for the lysene nobleman Moredo Rogare. Truth, he called it. It was forged from four daggers of valyrian steel, and the cost was enough to outfit an entire fleet of ships. Gather enough daggers, and I will be able to forge for you a new blade of pure, indestructable, valyrian steel, worthy of a king, a prince, even a dragonlord.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.21|Very well.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.22|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.168|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.20|Yes? Ah, you again. {playername}, I really do not have anything else to tell you about valyrian steel...
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.20|I have gathered the four daggers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.17|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.26|Truly? That is quite wonderous, {playername}, I did not think that would be possible unless you where to sack one of the other Free Cities. You did not do this deed, no? No sacking of those heathens occured in the search for these daggers, I can rest easy, yes?
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.20|Ah yes, these daggers are exquisite indeed. Forged in the fires of the Freehold. But ah! Forged anew in Qohor, the greatest of the Free Cities, heir to Old Valyria! The Black Goat will surely appreciate our sacrifice, and grant us the good fortune that we may create a blade such as the world has never seen before.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.23|Now, while these daggers certainly are of valyrian steel, they are not overly large. I can create a blade for you, but I cannot extend the metal or supplant it. You will have to be content with a short sword, but a sword it will certainly be. I can fashion it into whatever shape you desire. Which would that be?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.21|I desire a blade with a curved crossguard.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.22|I desire a blade fit for stabbing.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.23|I desire a short arming sword.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.11|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.21|Very well. I shall craft you such a blade. The process is laborous and costly. I do not haggle, and will name my price once the blade is ready. Return to me shortly, and the blade shall be ready for you.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.23|Very well.
; dlga_start:close_window.169|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.21|Welcome, welcome, traveller, to the Alchemist's Bend! Built in shadows by a sinister cabal of sorcerers and magi! According to the smallfolk. It wasn't really, you know. The last Hightower king, Lymond the Sea Lion, built it. How can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.21|I'm looking to buy some valyrian steel.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.18|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.27|Truly? Why, I have a huge pile just lying over here, by the basket of apples!
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.21|Hah! No, I don't. Valyrian steel... We do have some, it's true, but it's locked away down in the vaults, and I doubt Marwyn would part with the key. What would you need it for, anyhow? If you're considering becoming an acolyte, you can earn your own link in time...
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.24|Ah, I just realised, {playername}, that I do not care that much. This is the workshop where we do delicate work, and I really have to get back to the forge. What can I do for you that will make you leave?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.24|Tell me where to find valyrian steel.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.12|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.22|Fine. Take this list. Archmaester Mollos compiled it a couple of years ago. Gods knows why. It was part of a larger treatise on daggers... but still. Say, do you plan to visit the blacksmiths of Qohor? Pol did once. They are monsters. They reforge valyrian steel, it's true, but to do so, they practice blood magic. Blood sacrifice, slaves and infants slaughtered on the altar of the Black Goat.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.24|Thank you.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.25|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.170|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.22|Ah, {playername}. A joyous day, this. We have made something not often seen since the Doom came to Valyria so many years ago. Praise be to the Black Goat, the Harbinger, the Whisper in the Darkness, the Worm that Doth Come.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.22|So it is done then?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.19|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk5|It is done, and a fine blade it is. Our craft has grown stronger as of late, and the candles are once again burning. The Black Goat certainly has favored us in this endeavor, and we in return have sacrificed to the most fearsome of gods. Now there is the matter of our payment. We shall require 20000 coins for this most magnificent weapon, as the process of crafting it is not without its cost. Is this agreeable?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.25|It is.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.26|It is.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.27|It is.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.13|Not right now.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.23|Very good. If you should ever happen upon more steel, return to us and we will continue our work together, and make the secrets of Old Valyria unravel before us.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.26|Very well.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.27|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.171|Yes?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.6|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.5|Hah, yes, go bugger yourself. Or go see Lord Tyrion, you look the right sort for the work he offers. He's probably in the tower.
; dlga_start:close_window.172|Fuck off.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.23|Yes? Can I help you? I suppose you've come here at the behest of Bronn? The man's been sending me all kinds of queer folk to me these past days, sellswords and rogues the lot of them.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.23|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.20|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.28|Ah yes, I do. Tasks I have aplenty. The city lacks food, soldiers, weapons and proper queens, but I have more tasks than I know what to do with.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.22|What would you have me do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.25|Most of the lords of the Crownlands have sworn their allegiance to the king, but those close to the sea have been... unreliable in their support. Ser Jeffory Darke has not seen fit to appear at court, and has been riding around the countryside, spreading rumors of Joffreys parentage. It won't do. Look at the boy, it's clear who his father is.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.28|What do you want me to do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.14|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.24|The lords need to know that we won't tolerate such behavior. Ser Jefforys uncle was the one who alerted us to his nephews behavior. The king has seen fit to sentence Ser Jeffory to death, and grant his lands to this uncle. We need someone to carry out the sentence, but I don't want a long, drawn out, siege. Sneak into Ser Jefforys keep and put an end to him and his scheming.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.28|Very well, I will execute Ser Jeffory on behalf of King Joffrey.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.29|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.173|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.15|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.15|The uncle, I assume?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.16|I am Ser Rike Darke, yes, the uncle of Ser Jeffory.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.6|The king appreciates your help in putting an end to your nephews plotting, Ser Rike, and congratulates you on your ascension to master of Brookwater Keep. What a fortuitous circumstance, that you might serve your king, and gain a proper reward. Ser Jefforys father and grandfather might be proud.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.4|Yes, well...
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.15|Hmph!
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.16|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.16|Lord Tyrion, I've taken care of Ser Jeffory.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.17|Truly? Well done, {playername}. I'll make sure Bronn spreads the proper rumors about his demise. Should keep the rest of the lords in line. How did the uncle take it? Slimy worm, isn't he? Here, have this. One of my men found it in the castle cellar, supposively it belonged to Aemond the One-Eyed. It's old and worn, as you might expect of something that had a valyrian sword through it, and was then submerged in water for ten years, but it does have quite a story surrounding it.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.8|Thank you, my lord.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.7|May I know more about you, my lord?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.7|I am Tyrion Lannister, Hand of the King.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.16|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.5|Praise the Lord! The one that comes with shadows and fire!
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.7|Excuse me?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.6|Hah, yes, excuses! Go see the laquered lady! She's back soon, she's always back!
; dlga_start:close_window.174|Red lady, red lady, red lady, shadow lady!
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.24|{playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.24|How do you know my name?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.21|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.29|I saw it in the fires.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.23|What would you have me do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.26|Find the answers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.29|Erh...
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.15|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.25|Go north. Visit the fort of shadows. The Nightfort.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.30|Very well...
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.31|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.175|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.25|{playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.25|How do you know my name? Who are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.22|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.30|I saw your birth, and heard the name your mother bestowed upon you while you lay at her breast. I'm watching everything, and everyone, with a thousand eyes and one.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.24|How?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.27|The trees see all, and time is of no importance to them. The weirwoods hold many memories. My presence here is their memory.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.30|But how? I don't understand.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.16|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.26|The weirwoods will show you. Eat this paste, and you'll see.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.32|Very well...
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.33|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.176|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.26|Taste this pie! It's filled with gravy, onions, bacon and prince!
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.26|It's filled with prince?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:close_window|Tasty prince! The king wronged me, and now he'll pay! HE WILL PAY! The voices told me! They told me that the king was jesting about my knives! The voices... they have cold, blue, eyes...
; dlga_start:close_window.177|Tasty prince, tasty bacon, crazy king! Where's my children?!
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.27|Arh! The cold hurts! He's bound us!
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.27|Who has bound you? What are you talking about?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:close_window.1|HE bound us. With cold and blood, he's bound us to his will!
; dlga_start:close_window.178|Kill me! Please kill me!
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.6|Yes?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.8|Do you know of anyone who might have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.7|My uncle, Ser Gilbert, is looking for someone to do some... un-knightly work. He was here a minute ago, perhaps if you return later you can find him.
; dlga_start:close_window.179|Praise the Lord of Light.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.28|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.28|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.23|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.31|Ah yes, I do, I do. But you have to keep silent about this.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.25|What would you have me do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.28|Before the Old King abolished the lords right to the first night, the Targaryens where known to visit the smallfolk of Dragonstone to take their due, and they continued to do so even after the right was abolished. The resulting offspring was known as 'dragonseeds'. The dragonseeds used to be plenty on Dragonstone, but their numbers have dwindled over the years. However, recently a young man has been claiming to be the bastard son of Prince Rhaegar.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.31|Hmm... go on.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.17|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.27|This young man, going by the name of Lacerys, has been meeting with some of the knights from Hull, known to be descended from the Velaryons, and thus being akin to the dragonseeds. According to one of my informers, a man named Burlow, they've been talking of sneaking into the castle and overwhelming the guard, take the king hostage, and proclaim this Lacerys the true king of the Seven Kingdoms. This cannot be allowed to happen. I need you, {playername}, to break up the conspirators and execute the lot of them. They meet mostly at night, or when the fog rolls in from Dragonmont, obscuring the streets. We don't want to cause a scene, so just kill them and leave the bodies to be found.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.34|Very well, I will execute these conspirators.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.35|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.180|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.17|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.17|Burlow, I assume?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.18|Indeed I am, {playername}. Ser Gilbert told me you'd be coming.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.7|What do you think, Burlow? Was Lacerys the son of Rhaegar?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.5|Hah, that prancing fool? Not a chance. Plenty of silver-haired young men here on Dragonstone, the Targaryens had years to plant plenty of seeds. You'd be hard pressed to find someone without a bit of dragonblood on this island.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.17|Hmph!
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.18|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.18|Ser Gilbert, I've taken care of the conspirators.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.19|Truly? Well done, {playername}! His Grace, the king, has given me permission to choose a suitable reward from the armory in The Stone Drum. One of the weapons was rather fascinating. Taken from a Braavosi smuggler some years ago, it appears to be one of their slender blades, but forged for two hands rather than one. I imagine it would prove a rather poor cutting weapon, but it might prove to be exceptionally lethal as a stabbing tool. And of course, a monetary reward is due!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.9|Thank you, Ser Gilbert.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.18|Nevermind.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.8|Can you tell me more about the dragonseeds?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.8|I don't know much more than the next man. Perhaps you could go talk to Archmaester Perestan in Oldtown, he's devoted much of his life to the history of Westeros.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.7|Yes?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.9|Do you know of anyone who might have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.8|I did hear a rumor a few days ago... Phario Forel, the playwright, is looking for someone to search some old tomb... he'll probably be here in a couple of hours, for some reason he's infatuated with Merry...
; dlga_start:close_window.181|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.29|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.29|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.24|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.32|'The Father reached his hand into the heavens and pulled down seven stars and one by one he set them on the brow of Hugor of the Hill to make a glowing crown'...
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.26|Erh?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.29|It's from the Seven-Pointed Star you ignorant savage! Bunch of Westerosi nonsense, but they did get the crown part right. Of course, it's not made by a god...
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.32|Hmm... go on.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.18|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.28|The Andals wrought many fine treasures out of gold and copper. I have every reason to believe one of them might be buried in an old barrow, close to the Ruins of Iksa Calo. I need Andals treasures for my next play! The barrow is supposed to be haunted by wights and the ghosts of the Andal kings, but it's obviously just the wild rumours of madmen.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.36|Very well, I will search for your Andal treasues.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.37|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.182|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.19|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.19|I didn't find any Andal treasures.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.20|Truly? Oh the curse of the sea upon that old fool! The Third Sword swore that I'd find what I seek in that barrow!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.10|Well...
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.9|Can you tell me more about the Seven-Pointed Star?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.9|Read it yourself!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.19|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.8|Erh, yes?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.10|My lady, may I know more about you?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.9|No... but perhaps you can acquire my favor by helping out a dear friend. Find Moredo Tendyris and talk to him. He's probably in the tavern, he has a weakness for music.
; dlga_start:close_window.183|Go away.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.30|Yes?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.30|Lady Mellario said you where looking for help?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.33|Ah yes! Caravans have been disapperaing in the Pass of Hugor Hill. I suspect a band of outlaws might be using one of the caves as a hideout.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.27|What do you want me to do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.30|Go and search for the cave, and kill any outlaws you find
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.33|Hmm... go on.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.19|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.29|You'll need to deal with the outlaws yourself, you'll never be able to surprise them by lumbering around with half an army.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.38|Very well, I will take care of the outlaws.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.39|I am not interested.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.25|Farewell.
; dlga_start:close_window.184|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.20|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.20|I took care of the outlaws.

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.10|Can you tell me more about the Pass of Hugor Hill?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.10|Nothing to tell, really. The pass got its name from Hugor Hill, obviously. Everything in the highlands is named after some Andal religious figure.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.20|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.31|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.31|Did you have any more tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.26|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.34|Ah yes, I do. A close friend of mine has gone missing. He was visiting some ruined baths, north of Myr, but neither I, nor my associates, have heard from him since he set out weeks ago. He was supposed to be back by now. Foolish thing to visit baths, especially ruined ones, but there you are.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.28|What would you have me do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.31|Go look for him. If he has met with an unfortunate end, I need you to return any books or scrolls he might carry, but I pray that is not the case. But find out what happened to him, {playername}!
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.34|Hmm...
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.20|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.30|I'll make sure you're well rewarded!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.40|Very well, I will find this friend of yours.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.41|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.185|Yes?

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.21|Hmph!

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.22|Indeed I am, {playername}. My name is Haldon, and I appreciate the help. I've been looking for... nevermind. Anyhow, I ran into these bandits and they had me at their mercy when you came to my rescue.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.8|Glad I could be of help.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.6|I'm sure the magister will reward you handsomely for your work, {playername}. You seem an able fellow, and he might have... work for you, so visit him regularly.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.22|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.22|I found Haldon and rescued him from a band of bandits.

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.12|Thank you.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.11|Who is Haldon?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.11|Oh, just an old friend of mine. We call him 'Halfmaester' on account of him being almost a maester, but not quite.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.22|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.9|What are you doing here? This is the private estate of Magister Mopatis!
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.11|Who is this magister?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.10|He's one of the magisters of Pentos, you dolt! He should be back soon, and when he's back, he'll make you regret this trespassing! But if you have urgent business with him, you can find him at the court in Pentos.
; dlga_start:close_window.186|Get out of here!
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.32|Welcome, my friend. I see you just barged in, without an invitation, but welcome nonetheless. What are you doing here, if you don't mind me asking?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.32|I am {playername}, and I've come seeking adventure. Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.27|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.35|Yes, {playername}, I do, I do. I need someone to brave the Smoking Sea, and set sail for far away Meereen. An... acquaintance of mine has taken up residence in the city, and I would dearly like to keep in contact with her, and thus I need someone to deliver this letter. So what do you say, {playername}, are you man enough for such a journey?
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.29|I will brave this Smoking Sea and sail to Meereen!
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:close_window.1|I'm afraid I can't carry that right now.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.32|Splendid! You'll be well rewarded, I can assure you that. Once you reach Meereen, seek out Belandra Kheranes, she'll help you on your way. And just between us, if you where to bring some of your own coin with you on the journey, you might be able to make an excellent profit bringing back some spice. Now, sadly, my own ships are all away at sea, so you'll need to find your own way to Meereen.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.35|Where can I find a ship?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.21|On second thought, I think I'll stay on land.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.31|Travel to Volantis, and you may be able to hire a ship there. Visit the tavern and see if you can't find Bayle Neres. He's an old rogue, not averse to travelling past Valyria. For the right price.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.42|Very well, I'll return once I've seen Meereen.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.43|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.187|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.23|I'm busy, away with you!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.23|Are you Belandra Kheranes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.24|Yes, what's it to you?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.9|My name is {playername}. Illyrio Mopatis sent me to seek out a friend of his and deliver this letter. I was told you could help me get in contact with this person?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.5|Ah yes, {playername}, I can. The one you're looking for is named Barristan Selmy. If you head to the throne room, I'll make sure he'll meet you there.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:pj_wildfire_talk8.1|What if I he's not there?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk8:close_window.1|What if, what if. Don't worry, {playername}, he will be.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.23|Hmph!
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.24|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.24|Barristan Selmy? I've been sent with a letter.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.25|Magister Illyrio has been a steadfast friend of the queens cause. I thank you for bringing me this, {playername}. Did you bring any additional messages from him?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.10|No, he simply tasked me with making sure you received this letter, but he also asks that you keep him informed of your intentions.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.6|Very well, {playername}. I'll have Missandei see to it that Magister Illyrio is kept aware of our intentions. Perhaps you should speak to Skahaz mo Kandaq, if you want to continue serving our cause, he may well have tasks for you.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:close_window.2|Thank you.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.24|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.25|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.25|Skahaz mo Kandaq? Ser Barristan told me you might have tasks for me?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.26|Looking for work then? I believe I have a task for you, if you're man enough to handle it. Few are, but that's the general condition of people these days. Fret not, Meereen will be made great again.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk4.3|Very wel.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk4:pj_wildfire_talk5.3|My family has many dealings with the Free Cities. Her grace has, in her wisdom, outlawed slavery, and it's imperative that we find new ways to keep our markets full. To that effect, I've decided to send one of my own merchant vessels toward Tyrosh, that we might establish some small link with the trade of the Narrow Sea. But first the ship has to traverse the Stepstones, a notorious haunt of pirates. The lyseni cleared the islands a year ago, so the pirates have not yet been able to recover their strenght, but on the island of Bloodstone, there's an inkling of a new stronghold. I need you to go there and dispatch the pirates making it their home.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.7|I'll clear out these pirates.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:close_window.3|Very well. It has been a pleasure, {playername}.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.25|Nothing, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.26|What do you want?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.26|I'm looking for the pirates who have recently made Bloodstone their home.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.27|They ain't here right now, they all went to the south of the island. Was going to prey on some myrish galley they said. Can't be a big galley, there's only eight of them, hah. What's it to you anyhow?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.11|None of your concern!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.7|Alright, alright, no harm done.
; dlga_nacroxnicke_creditos:close_window.2|Guardsman. I'm just guarding this here gate.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.26|Nothing.
; dlga_start:pj_germund_talk.2|Yes, {playername}
; dlga_pj_germund_talk:wildfire_espada.1|I've returned from the east.
; dlga_wildfire_espada:wildfire_espada2.1|Wonderful, {playername}! Did you find Ser Barristan? Is he well? Here, take this gift as my way of thanking you! Perhaps you'll be wanting to make use of it once the queen claims her rightful throne, eh?
; dlga_wildfire_espada2:new_one_wildfire.1|Thank you, magister.
; dlga_new_one_wildfire:close_window.1|It's nothing, nothing! Say, should you wish to earn riches beyond your wildest dreams, then return to me in a couple of hours, I might have more work for you.

; dlga_start:trainer_intro_1|Good day to you {lad/lass}. You look like another adventurer who has come to try {his/her} chance in these lands. Well, trust my word, you won't be able to survive long here unless you know how to fight yourself out of a tight spot.
; dlga_trainer_intro_1:trainer_intro_2|Thank you for your advice. This place looks like a training field. Maybe I can learn about fighting here?
; dlga_trainer_intro_2:trainer_intro_3|Indeed you can. I am a veteran soldier... fought a good deal in the wars in my time. But these days, I train young novices in this area. I can find you some opponents to practice with if you like. Or if you have any questions about the theory of combat, feel free to ask.
; dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4a|Yes, I do have a few questions.
; dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4b|Actually, I can move on to practice.
; dlga_trainer_intro_4a:trainer_talk_combat|Well, ask anything you like.
; dlga_trainer_intro_4b:trainer_practice_1|Good. It's good to find someone eager for practice. Let's see what you will do.
; dlga_start:trainer_practice_1|That was a good fight. 
; dlga_start:trainer_practice_1.1|Ha! Looks like you've developed a bit of a limp there. Don't worry, even losses have their value, provided you learn from them. Shake the stars out of your eyes and get back in there. There's no other way to win.
; dlga_start:trainer_talk|Good day. Ready for some training today?
; dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Ah, are you ready for some training?
; dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_practice_1|I am ready for some practice.
; dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
; dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.
; dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?
; dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have a shield?
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1|I train novices in four stages, each tougher than the one before. To finish a stage and advance to the next one, you have to win three fights in a row.
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready|You have passed all stages of training. But if you want you can still practice. Are you ready?
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.1|Way to go {lad/lass}. With this victory, you have advanced to the next training level. From now on your opponents will be regular fighters, not the riff-raff off the street, so be on your toes.
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.2|Way to go {lad/lass}. Welcome to the third training level. From now on your opponents will be veteran fighters; soldiers and arena regulars and the like. These guys know some dirty tricks, so keep your defense up.
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.3|You've got the heart of a champion, {lad/lass}, and the sword arm to match. From now on your opponents will be champion fighters. These are the cream of the crop, the finest warriors I have trained. If you can best three of them in a row, you will join their ranks.
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_finish_training|It does my heart good to see such a promising talent. You have passed all tiers of training. You can now tell everyone that you have been trained by the master of the training field.

; dlga_novicemaster_finish_training_2:close_window|I wish you good luck in the tourneys. And, don't forget,  if you want to practice your swordwork anytime, just come and say the word.

; dlga_iron_bank_noho_master_customize2:iron_bank_noho_master_talk|Though all the Free Cities have their own banks, the Iron Bank is richer and more powerful than all the others combined.

During the Age of Heroes, Lann the Clever tricked them out of their castle, and claimed it for his own. It was the seat of the Kings of the Rock until the conquest, and remained the seat of the Wardens of the West. During the Blackfyre Rebellion, lord Leo Lefford was slain by Quentyn Ball outside the gates of Lannisport, who then proceeded to besiege the Rock. When the Grey Lion came out to challenge him, he was forced back inside, but Quentyn Ball was unable to take the castle.

; dlga_jurne_master_customize1:jurne_master_customize2| It was said that he raised six each larger and more formidable until he raised Storm's End. Some believe this was because the children of the forest took a hand in its construction, using their magics in the raising the castle walls allowing it to resist the storms.
; dlga_jurne_master_customize2:jurne_master_talk|Others believe that a young boy who grew up to be Bran the Builder advised Durran on its construction. The truth of the matter is unknown.

; dlga_norren_master_talk:norren_master_customize|Can you tell me about Oldtown?
; dlga_norren_master_customize:norren_master_customize1|Hmph! I suppose. Oldtown is the oldest city in Westeros, pre-dating the invasion of the Andals. Maester Jellicoe suggests that the first settlement here was a trading post of the valyrian Freehold where they traded with the elder races. Hogwash, I say!
; dlga_norren_master_customize1:norren_master_customize2|It's quite clear that the first settlement here was the Ravenry, which we, the maesters, now control. There's the small matter of the foundations of the High Tower, but we're sure to solve that riddle sometime... 
; dlga_norren_master_customize2:norren_master_talk|As the location of the Citadel, Oldtown is the foremost center of learning known to man, and as the former seat of the Faith of the Seven, the city is considered by many to be sacred.

; dlga_theobald_master_talk:theobald_master_customize|Can you tell me about the Citadel?
; dlga_theobald_master_customize:theobald_master_customize1|Gladly. The Citadel is considered the home of all maesters. This is where they undergo all the training taking them from novice to maester.
; dlga_theobald_master_customize1:theobald_master_customize2|It was founded with the help of the Hightowers, who continue to be strong patrons of learning, and often come here to receive a few years of training themselves. The Citadel is also home of the Archmaesters, the governing body of the Order of Maesters, and it is where we hold the conclave that decides who will be Grand Maester.

; dlga_marwyn_introduce_2:marwyn_master_talk|My name is Marwyn. Some call me 'the Mage'. I specialize in the mysteries of the world, what most people would call magic.
; dlga_marwyn_master_talk:marwyn_master_customize|Can you tell me about magic?
; dlga_marwyn_master_customize:marwyn_master_customize1|Of course I can. But remember, the term magic is broad, and it has a different meaning to many people. Ignorant peasants may call a lords ability to handle sword and lance magic, and many is the town whore who has sworn she saw a dragon crossing the sky, when all she saw was a falling star.
; dlga_marwyn_master_customize1:marwyn_master_customize2|However, magic is a real force in this world, though it grows weaker... Or should I say, it grew weaker. I'm no longer so sure. Something stirs in the east. There has been signs, portents...
; dlga_marwyn_master_customize2:marwyn_master_talk|But you wanted to know about magic. I'd advice you to read Archmaester Pellandons book 'Magic and Mysteries'.

; dlga_marwyn_master_customize:marwyn_master_customize1.1|Of course I can. They contain books.

; dlga_myles_master_talk:myles_master_customize|Can you tell me about Dorne?
; dlga_myles_master_customize:myles_master_customize1|I guess. Dorne is comprised of many different people. When the Rhoynar invaded, they mixed with the Andals already living here.
; dlga_myles_master_customize1:myles_master_customize2|Dorne is bordered by the Sea of Dorne to the north, the islands known as the Stepstones to the east, and the Summer Sea to the south. Stretched between them is the mountain range known as the Red Mountains, which separates Dorne from the remainder of the Seven Kingdoms by land.
; dlga_myles_master_customize2:myles_master_talk|Dorne is the hottest region in Westeros. The region is rocky, mountainous, arid and dry, and features the only desert on the continent. Its rivers provide some fertile lands and even during a long summer there is enough rain and other supplies of water to keep Dorne habitable. Inland water is almost as valuable as gold, and wells are jealously guarded.

; dlga_vyman_master_talk:vyman_master_customize|Can you tell me about the Riverlands?
; dlga_vyman_master_customize:vyman_master_customize1|I guess. The land is named for the many rivers that flow across the plains. The largest of them, the Trident, is rivaled only by the Mander and the Rhoyne.
; dlga_vyman_master_customize1:vyman_master_customize2|The Riverlands is not considered one of the traditional Seven Kingdoms, as they where ruled by the ironborn before the Conquest. When Aegon invaded, house Tully was one of the first to swear fealty to him, and as a result, Aegon named Lord Tully the ruler of the Riverlands.
; dlga_vyman_master_customize2:vyman_master_talk|During Robert's Rebellion, the final battle was fought on the banks of the Trident. King Robert met Prince Rhaegar in the waters, and there he caved in the chest of the prince, winning the throne.

; dlga_colemon_master_talk:colemon_master_customize|Can you tell me about the Vale?
; dlga_colemon_master_customize:colemon_master_customize1|I suppose. The Vale is where the Andals initially landed. As such the Arryns are one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility in the Seven Kingdoms and ruled as Kings of Mountain and Vale for centuries until they bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror when the young king wanted to ride a dragon.
; dlga_colemon_master_customize1:colemon_master_customize2|When the Mad King demanded that Jon Arryn give up his wards, Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, he instead raised his banners in revolt. During the battle of the Trident, the knights of the Vale proved indispensable in defeating the Targaryen host.
; dlga_colemon_master_customize2:colemon_master_talk|After Lord Arryns death, the lady Lysa returned here, to rule the Vale until her son comes of age.

; dlga_wendamyr_master_talk:wendamyr_master_customize|Can you tell me about the Iron Islands?
; dlga_wendamyr_master_customize:wendamyr_master_customize1|I suppose. The Iron Islands consists of seven major islands, Pyke, Great Wyk, Old Wyk, Harlaw, Saltcliffe, Blacktyde and Orkmont. Before the Conquest, the ironborn held sway wherever the sound of waves where heard, and ruled the Riverlands. When Balerion the Black Dread burned Harren and all his sons in the tower of Kingspyre, King Aegon offered the ironborn to choose amongst themselves who would hold supremacy over them. They choose Vickon Greyjoy and his line.
; dlga_wendamyr_master_customize1:wendamyr_master_customize2|The men of the Iron Islands have ever felt the strain of being unable to return to the Old Ways, and various Greyjoys have rebelled over the years. Before Balons rebellion, the last rebellion was led by Dagon Greyjoy, who prevailed against the lords Stark and Lannister, but was unable to defeat the Targaryens..
; dlga_wendamyr_master_customize2:wendamyr_master_talk|Opposed to the rest of Westeros, the Andals did not convert the First Men of the Isles to the Faith of the Seven, but rather saw themselves converted. The ironborn worship the Drowned God, who wages eternal war agains the Storm God. It is said the Drowned God made the ironborn to reave and rape, to carve out kingdoms for themselves and to make their names known in fire, blood and song.

Using vile sorcery, he bound the men of the Night's Watch to his will, and made them do his bidding. During those dark years, horrible atrocities where commited. In the end, the King in the North and Joramun, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined their forces and brought down the Night's King, freeing the men of the Night's Watch from his hold on them. 
; dlga_old_nan_master_customize2:old_nan_master_talk|When the two kings searched the Nightfort, they found that the Night's King had been sacrificing to the Others. The kings never spoke of what they saw, but it was decreed that the name of the Night's King may never be spoken again by living man. There are many tales about who the Night's King was. Some say a Bolton, other mentions the Umbers. Don't you believe them. The man who became the Night's King was born here in Winterfell, the younger brother of the same King in the North who killed him.

; dlga_bartimus_introduce_1:bartimus_introduce_2|Who are you?
; dlga_bartimus_introduce_2:bartimus_master_talk|I'm Ser Bartimus, castellan of the Wolf's Den.
; dlga_bartimus_master_talk:bartimus_master_customize|Can you tell me about the Wolf's Den?
; dlga_bartimus_master_customize:bartimus_master_customize1|Yes, gladly! King Jon Stark raised the Wolf's Den to defend the mouth of the White Knife from raiders from the sea. It was the seat of younger sons, brothers, uncles and cousins to the King in the North. Some passed the castle to their sons and grandsons, and cadet branches of House Stark have ruled the Wolf's Den. The Greystarks lasted for five hundred years, until they rose in rebellion against Winterfell.
; dlga_bartimus_master_customize1:bartimus_master_customize2|After the Greystarks, the castle switched many hands. House Flint held it for century, and House Locke for almost two. Slates, Longs, Holts and Ashwoods held the Wolf's Den, charged by Winterfell to keep the river safe. Reavers from the Three Sisters took the castle once, and made it their toehold in the north. During the wars between the North and the Vale, it was besieged by Osgood Arryn, the Old Falcon, and burned by his son, the one they called 'the Talon'. The Wolf's Den was captured by slavers from the Stepstones when Edrick Stark had grown too feeble to defend his realm. Then a long, cruel winter came that froze the White Knife. When the slavers were huddled around their fires, Edrick's great-grandson, the king they called 'Ice Eyes', took back the Wolf's Den. He stripped the slavers naked and gave them to the slaves chained up in the dungeon. They, amongst them my own ancestors, hung the slavers' entrails in the branches of the heart tree as an offering to the Old Gods.
; dlga_bartimus_master_customize2:bartimus_master_talk|A thousand years before the conquest, the Manderlys took oaths before the old gods and the new to be the Starks of Winterfell's men forever in return for protection from their enemies and the land around the Wolf's Den that became White Harbor.

; dlga_bartimus_master_customize1:bartimus_master_customize2.1|The Night's Watch originally raised nineteen castles along the Wall, but only three are in use now. The original main castle was the Nightfort, but for obvious... reasons, it was abandoned after the reign of the Night's King.

; dlga_tybald_master_talk:tybald_master_customize|Can you tell me about house Bolton?
; dlga_tybald_master_customize:tybald_master_customize1|Yes, I suppose. The Boltons are an ancient and powerful house of the North who for many centuries were bitter rivals of the Kings in the North, the Starks of Winterfell.
; dlga_tybald_master_customize1:tybald_master_customize2|The Boltons achieved some successes against the Starks, flaying the skins of several Stark lords and hanging them in their stronghold, the Dreadfort. According to rumor, some Bolton lords even wore the flayed skins of their enemies - including the Starks - as cloaks.
; dlga_tybald_master_customize2:tybald_master_talk|Approximately a thousand years ago, the Boltons finally swore fealty to the Kings in the North and agreed to abandon their practice of flaying their enemies. However, three hundred years later the Boltons rose in rebellion against the Starks. The Stark armies besieged the Dreadfort for four years before the Boltons finally capitulated and dipped their banners once more. For many centuries the Boltons remained loyal to the Starks, although rumors persisted that they continued to flay their prisoners in secret, and maintain a hidden chamber in the Dreadfort to display the skins of their enemies.

; dlga_saltpans_elder_brother_master_customize:saltpans_elder_brother_master_customize1|Yes, I would be glad to. Those who dwell here are penitents. We seek to atone for our sins through quiet contemplation, penitence and prayer. Many come to escape the horrors of war and thus I keep the worst of the news from my brothers. Our island is protected by the mud and tides, and the Mother shelters us from the ravages of the mainland.
; dlga_saltpans_elder_brother_master_customize1:saltpans_elder_brother_master_customize2|Forgive me, Elder Brother, but you do not look like a typical member of the faith How did you come to this place?
; dlga_saltpans_elder_brother_master_customize2:saltpans_elder_brother_master_talk2|You're right my friend, I have not always lived on this island. Once, I was a knight. At the Battle of the Trident, I fought for the Targaryens, and was knocked out by a blow to the head. I was left for dead, robbed of my armor, and floated into the Bay of Crabs. When I woke up, I was lying face down in the mud, and that is where my brothers found me. I was a vain man before the tides brought me here, and the Gods have seen fit to give me a second chance.

; dlga_stoneman_master_talk:stoneman_master_customize|Can you tell me about this place? It seems strange.
; dlga_stoneman_master_customize:stoneman_master_customize1|Chroyane, nicknamed the festival city, was once the richest and most splendid of the cities along the Rhoyne. Its streets were said to be made of water and its houses of gold.
; dlga_stoneman_master_customize1:stoneman_master_customize2|According to legend, the men of Volantis and Valyria hung Prince Garin in a golden cage after defeating the Rhoynar. Garin allegedly called upon Mother Rhoyne to destroy the invaders with a curse; that night the river's waters rose to destroy the volantenes and valyrians. The spirits of the drowned lords of fire are said to remain beneath the water, however, and their cold breath rises to become fog.

; dlga_comaelle_master_customize:comaelle_master_customize1|Once there was a young boy, born with a golden navel. His mother didn't know how he came to have such a navel. No one in his village knew either.
; dlga_comaelle_master_customize1:comaelle_master_customize2|The boy grew up, and left the village. He travelled the world, seeking an answer for his golden navel. He sought out shadowbinders in Asshai, warlocks in Qarth, and sorcerers in Valyria. But none knew the reason for his golden navel.
; dlga_comaelle_master_customize2:comaelle_master_talk3|Finally, he came upon a hermit, living in a tree. The hermit turned the boys navel around, ten times. Then he turned it another ten.

; dlga_beowulf_talk2:beowulf_talk3|Oh, there is little more to tell. Every singer wanders far, and boasts of the places he has seen, the people he's met. Singers the world have plenty of, but heroes? Now that's a different matter entirely. Imagine, if you will, a great hero, on a daring quest.
; dlga_beowulf_talk3:beowulf_talk4|What quest?
; dlga_beowulf_talk3:close_window|Excuse me, I have important matters that require my attention.
; dlga_beowulf_talk4:beowulf_talk5|I have a treasure with me, a war mace. It was given to me for services rendered, but I do not have any use for it. It's called Coldbringer. I will give Coldbringer to you, if you go on a quest to retrieve two items for me. A book and a horn.
; dlga_beowulf_talk5:beowulf_talk6|A war mace? Hmph, sure. Will any horn and book do or do you need something special?
; dlga_beowulf_talk5:close_window|I have better things to do than to chase after some horn and glittery jewelry. Farewell.
; dlga_beowulf_talk6:beowulf_talk7|Oh, it has to be a very special horn and book. Not just a book, a grimoire. I am old, but you can make the journey I cannot. You must meet an old hermit, Rodgar.

; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk2:pj_beowulf_talk3.2|Yes... what is it to you? You want the book? Take it! I've been plagued by nightmares ever since I dug it out the ground! I thought it was valuable, and it might be! But the pictures in it... and the nightmares... shadows moving across a forest... attacking a hill... there's a huge bear, long dead, eyes blue and cold...
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk3:pj_beowulf_talk4|Give me the book AND the horn.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk3:close_window|I can't carry that right now..
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk4:pj_beowulf_talk5|I don't have the horn anymore! It never even left Harrenhal! That goat took it from me! Him and his bloody mummers, pah! They didn't have the right! I was there under a banner of peace, to ransom my cousin!
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk5:pj_beowulf_talk6.2|Yes, it's all very sad. Where can I find this... goat?
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk5:pj_beowulf_talk7|Tell me where the horn is. Now!
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk6:close_window.1|I imagine he's still at Harrenhal. He's' not actually a goat, you know. Just some sellsword from Qohor. His name is Vargo Hoat.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk7:close_window|I yield! I yield! It must still be with Vargo Hoat at Harrenhal! Unless the castles been taken by someone else! I don't think he'd survive long as a captive of the Starks!

; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk2:pj_beowulf_talk3.4|Yes, I do. I've been waiting for you, {playername}. You want the horn? Sure you do. But you can't have it. The horn is evil. Very evil. There's a darkness to it, a terrible darkness. Let me keep it, and I'll pray for you. The Lord of Light will surely grant you great favors!
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk3:pj_beowulf_talk4.1|No... I already gave my word, and I want the horn. Now.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk3:close_window.1|I can't carry it right now.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk4:pj_beowulf_talk5.1|Well, I am no warrior to fight you for it. But I have my tricks, and I'm handy with a dagger. Very handy. If you truly want the horn, all you have to do is solve a small riddle. The Lord of Light will favor me, and blind your mind to the true answer. If you fail, the horn shall never belong to you. I've coated the inside with wildfire, and a single shake will make the horn catch fire.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk5:pj_beowulf_talk6.3|Hear my riddle! When my first is a task to a young lady of spirit, and my second confines her to finish the piece, how hard is her fate! But how great is her merit, if by taking me whole she effects her release!

; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk:close_window.4|I forgot.

; dlga_pj_samol_talk:beowulf_espada|I have the horn and the book.

; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.10|Yes, can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.12|Who's in charge here?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.11|That would be Elder Brother, but I'm afraid he's not here right now. He went to Fairmarket to enlist the help of valiant men to right the wrongs done to us.
; dlga_start:close_window.321|Excuse me, I'm very busy.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.33|The Father watch over you, {brother/sister}. Have you come to help us in our time of need?

; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.28|I'm sorry, no.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.36|A company of our brothers recently returned from a journey to the Starry Sept at Oldtown. Amongst the things they brought north was a relic of Baelor the Blessed himself! A ring, said to have been worn by the king when he went to Dorne, to rescue the Dragonknight from the pit of snakes! But on the road, not far from Raventree Hall, they where attacked by Aegon Bloodborn, the outlaw son of Ser Aenys Frey. I thought he'd died years ago, but brother Toman swore it was him. He stole all of the brothers supplies and goods, and the ring besides! Find him, {playername}, and bring him to justice! There's been reports of outlaws close to The High Fall, might be you'd find him there.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.30|I'll bring you his head!
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:close_window|He might also have sought refuge with his sire at The Crossing. With war spreading across the land, one outlaw hiding at his grandfathers castle could easily go unnoticed.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.44|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.322|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.27|What are you here for?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.27|I've come for the relic you stole. Hand it over!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.28|Hah! When I'm done with you, not even the prayers of the High Septon will save you! Do you truly believe you can harm me here, in my lord grandfathers casle?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.12|No, but you will have to leave eventually. When you do, you die.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.8|Maybe it'll be you choking on your own blood!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.27|Hmph!
; dlga_start:order2.4|I'll hang you from a tree!
; dlga_order2:order3.4|We'll see about that!
; dlga_order3:close_window.4|I'll make you regret this!
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.28|Did you bring Aegon Bloodborn to justice?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.28|Yes! It was quite difficult.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.29|Really? Well done {playername}! I have a gift for you, a book. The Seven-Pointed Star, the holy book of our faith. Treasure it, to show your devotion to the Seven!

; dlga_start_craftsman_soon:close_window|Good day, my {lord/lady}. We hope to begin production in about {reg4} days
; dlga_start:master_craftsman_talk|Good day, my {lord/lady}. We are honored that you have chosen to visit us. What do you require?
; dlga_master_craftsman_pretalk:master_craftsman_talk|Very good, my {lord/lady}. Do you require anything else?
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_accounts|Let's go over the accounts.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk|Let's check the inventories.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.1|I'd like you to sell goods as they are produced.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.2|I'd like you to keep all goods in the warehouse until I arrive.
; dlga_master_craftsman_accounts:master_craftsman_pretalk|We currently produce {s3} worth {reg1} coins each week, while the quantity of {s4} needed to manufacture it costs {reg2}, and labor and upkeep are {reg3}.{s9} This means that we theoretically make a {s12} of {reg0} coins a week, assuming that we have no raw materials in the inventories, and that we sell directly to the market.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_production_options|Could you explain my options related to production?
; dlga_master_craftsman_production_options:master_craftsman_production_options_2|Certainly, my {lord/lady}. Most of the time, the most profitable thing for you to do would be to let us buy raw materials and sell the finished goods directly to the market. Because of our longstanding relations with the local merchants, we can usually get a very good price.
; dlga_master_craftsman_production_options_2:master_craftsman_pretalk|However, if you find that you can acquire raw materials cheaper outside {s5}, you may place them in the inventories, and we will use them instead of buying from the market. Likewise, if you feel that you can get a better price for the finished goods elsewhere, then you may ask us to deposit what we produce in our warehouses for you to take.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_auction_price|It will no longer be possible for me to continue operating this enterprise.
; dlga_master_craftsman_auction_price:master_craftsman_auction_decide|A pity, my {lord/lady}. If we sell the land and the equipment, and liquidate the inventories, I estimate that we can get {reg4} coins.
; dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_liquidation|That sounds reasonable. Please proceed with the sale.
; dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_pretalk|Hmm. Let's hold off on that.
; dlga_master_craftsman_liquidation:close_window|As you wish. It was an honor to have been in your employ.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:close_window.1|That is all for now.
; dlga_start:mayor_begin|Good day, {s0}.
; dlga_start:mayor_talk|Hello stranger, you seem to be new to {s9}. I am the guild master of the town.
; dlga_start:mayor_begin.1|Good day, {playername}.
; dlga_mayor_begin:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed|{playername}, it was an incredible feat to get {s14} and {s15} make peace, and you made it happen. Your involvement has not only saved our town from disaster, but it has also saved thousands of lives, and put an end to all the grief this bitter war has caused. As the townspeople of {s19}, know that we'll be good on our word, and we are ready to pay the {reg12} coins we promised.
; dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay|Thank you. Let me have the money.
; dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay|No need for a payment. I only did what was right.
; dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay:close_window|Oh, yes, of course. We had already got the money for you. Here, please accept these {reg12} coins together with our most sincere thanks. Me and the people of our town will not forget your help.
; dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay:close_window|You are indeed an extraordenary person, and it is an honour for me to have known you. You not only did what was impossible and put an end to this terrible war, but you won't even accept a reward for it. Very well, I will not insist on the matter, but please know that you will have our eternal respect and gratitude.
; dlga_mayor_begin:lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed|Very nice work, {playername}, you made short work of those lawless curs. Thank you kindly for all your help, and please accept this bounty of 150 coins.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed:close_window|It was my pleasure, {s65}.
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_looters_quest_response|Ah, {playername}. Have you any progress to report?
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed|I've killed some looters.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods|I've brought you some goods.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:close_window|Not yet, sir. Farewell.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2|Aye, my scouts saw the whole thing. That should make anyone else think twice before turning outlaw! The bounty is 70 coins for every band, so that makes {reg1} in total. Here is your money, as promised.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:close_window|And that's not the only good news! Thanks to you, the looters have ceased to be a threat. We've not had a single attack reported for some time now. If there are any of them left, they've either run off or gone deep into hiding. That's good for business, and what's good for business is good for the town! I think that concludes our arrangement, {playername}. Please accept this silver as a token of my gratitude. Thank you, and farewell.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:mayor_looters_quest_response|Anything else you need?
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Hah, I knew I could count on you! Just tell me which item to take from your baggage, and I'll send some men to collect it. I still need {reg1} coins worth of goods.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_2|{s5}.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_3|Nothing at the moment, sir.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_3:mayor_looters_quest_response|Anything else you need?
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Excellent, here is the money for your {s6}. Do you have any more goods to give me? I still need {reg1} coins worth of goods.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:close_window|Well done, {playername}, that's the last of the goods I need. Here is the money for your {s6}, and a small bonus for helping me out. I'm afraid I won't be paying for any more goods, nor bounties on looters, but you're welcome to keep hunting the bastards if any remain. Thank you for your help, I won't forget it.
; dlga_mayor_begin:close_window|Good to see you again {playername}. I have heard that you have delivered the cattle successfully. I will tell the merchants how reliable you are. And here is your pay, {reg8} coins.
; dlga_mayor_begin:move_cattle_herd_failed|I heard that you have lost the cattle herd on your way to {s9}. I had a very difficult time explaining your failure to the owner of that herd, {Ser/my lady}. Do you have anything to say?
; dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2|I am sorry. But I was attacked on the way.
; dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2.1|I am sorry. The stupid animals wandered off during the night.
; dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed_2:merchant_ask_for_debts|Well, it was your responsibility to deliver that herd safely, no matter what. You should know that the owner of the herd demanded to be compensated for his loss, and I had to pay him 1000 coins. So you now owe me that money.
; dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.1|{playername} -- I am in your debt for bringing back my friend's daughter.  Please take these {reg8} coins that I promised you.  My friend wished he could give more but paying that ransom brought him to his knees.
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those thieves the punishment they deserved. Here is your reward, {reg5} coins. I would like to give more but wine and food doesn't come cheap these days. Hard luck, eh? 
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.1|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those nasty sellswords the punishment they deserved.  I hope they weren't too much trouble, petty outlaws and criminals are nothing to you, I'd imagine. Here is your reward, {reg5} coins. I would like to give more but alas, with all this turmoil and strife... Well, you know...
; dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.2|I heard you dealt with our little problem, {playername}. I can see you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh? You might consider taking it up full time. Well, here's your reward.
; dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.3|Oh, it's you. Enlighten me, how exactly does one lose a simple fight to some poxy, lowborn barflies? Truly, if I ever want to take a lesson in how to lay down and die, I'll be sure to come to you. Get out of my sight, {playername}, I have things to do.
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.2|Well -- it sounds like you were able to track down the bandits, and show them what happens to those who would disrupt the flow of commerce. Here is your reward: {reg5} coins. It is well earned, and we are most grateful.
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.3|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those bandits the punishment they deserved. You are really as good as they say. Here is your reward: {reg5} coins. I would like to give more but those bandits almost brought me to bankruptcy.
; dlga_mayor_begin:merchant_ask_for_debts|According to my accounts, you owe the merchants guild {reg1} coins. I'd better collect that now.
; dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_paid|Alright. I'll pay my debt to you.
; dlga_merchant_debts_paid:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I'll let my fellow merchants know that you are clear of any debts.
; dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_not_paid|I'm afraid I can't pay that sum now.
; dlga_merchant_debts_not_paid:close_window|In that case, I am afraid, I can't deal with you. Guild rules... Come back when you can pay the {reg1} coins. And know that we'll be charging an interest to your debt. So the sooner you pay it, the better.
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_talk|What can I do for you?
; dlga_mayor_friendly_pretalk:mayor_talk|Now... What else may I do for you?
; dlga_mayor_pretalk:mayor_talk|Yes?
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_info_begin|Can you tell me about what you do?
; dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_requested|Do you happen to have a job for me?
; dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_last_offered_job|About that job you offered me...
; dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_about_job|About the job you gave me...
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_political_talk|I have some questions of a political nature.
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_economy_report_1|How is trade around here?
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_wealth_comparison_1|How does the wealth of this region compare with the rest of the world?
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_investment_possible|I wish to buy land in this town for a productive enterprise
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk|You already operate a {s4} here. There probably aren't enough skilled tradesmen to start a second enterprise.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.1|{s9}
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.1|Of course, {s0}. You are the lord of this town, and no one is going to stop you.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment|Well... Given your relationship with our liege, {s4}, I think that you will not find many here who are brave enough to sell you any land.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.2|Well... To be honest, I think that we in the guild would like to know you a little better. We can be very particular about outsiders coming in here and buying land.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.2|Very good, {s0}. We in the guild know and trust you, and I think I could find someone to sell you the land you need.
; dlga_mayor_investment_advice:investment_choose_enterprise|A couple of things to keep in mind -- skilled laborers are always at a premium, so I doubt that you will be able to open up more than one enterprise here. In order to make a profit for yourself, you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply, but for which the raw materials are cheap. What sort of enterprise would you like to start?
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary|A mill and bakery, to make bread from grain
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.1|A brewery, to make ale from grain
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.2|A tannery, to make leather from hides
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.3|A wine press, to make wine from grapes
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.4|An oil press, to make oil from olives
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.5|An ironworks, to make tools from iron
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.6|A weavery and dyeworks, to make velvet from silk and dye
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.7|A weavery, to make wool cloth from wool
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.8|A weavery, to make linen from flax
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:mayor_pretalk|Never mind
; dlga_investment_summary:mayor_investment_confirm|Very good, sir. The land and the materials on which you may build your {s3} will cost you {reg7} coins. Right now, your {s3} will produce {s4} worth {reg1} coins each week, while the {s6} needed to manufacture that batch will be {reg2} and labor and upkeep will be {reg3}.{s9} I should guess that your profit would be {reg0} coins a week. This assumes of course that prices remain constant -- which, I can virtually guarantee you, they will not. Do you wish to proceed?
; dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_investment_purchase|Yes. Here is money for the land.
; dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_investment_advice|No -- that's not economical for me at the moment.
; dlga_mayor_investment_purchase:mayor_pretalk|Very good. Your enterprise should be up and running in about a week. When next you come, and thereafter, you should speak to your {s4} about its operations.
; dlga_mayor_talk:close_window|[Leave]
; dlga_mayor_info_begin:mayor_info_talk|I am the guildmaster of {s9}. You can say I am the leader of the good people of {s9}. I can help you find a job if you are looking for some honest work.
; dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_info_lord|Who rules this town?
; dlga_mayor_info_lord:mayor_info_talk|Our town's lord and protector is {s10}. {reg0?She:He} owns the castle and sometimes resides there, and collects taxes from the town. However we regulate ourselves in most of the matters that concern ourselves. As the town's guildmaster I have the authority to decide those things.
; dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thanks.
; dlga_mayor_political_talk:mayor_political_questions|Politics? Good heaven, the guild has nothing to do with politics. We are loyal servants of {s10}. We merely govern our own affairs, and pass on the townspeople's concerns to our lords and masters, and maybe warn them from time to time against evil advice. Anyway, what did you wish to ask?
; dlga_mayor_prepolitics:mayor_political_questions|Did I mention that we here are all {s9}? Because I can't stress that enough... Anyway... Is there anything else?
; dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_war_description_1|What is the cause of all these wars?
; dlga_mayor_war_description_1:mayor_war_description_2|Well, to answer your question generally, each of the western monarchs claims to be the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, with the exception of the Stark boy who just wants to rule the North and the Trident.. Some of these claims are based on forgotten dynastic marriages and others are based on obscure promises, while Myr, Volantis, Lys and Tyrosh have been fighting over the Disputed Lands since the doom of Valyria, and Braavos has a long standing enmity towards the former valyrian cities. So in theory, any one realm has the right to declare war on any other realm at any time.
; dlga_mayor_war_description_2:mayor_war_description_3|In practice, to make war is exhausting work. It is easy enough to lay waste to the enemy's farmland, but crops will grow back, and it is a far different matter to capture an enemy stronghold and to hold it. So the monarchs and archons will fight a little, sign a truce, fight a little more, and so on and so forth. Often, a monarch will go to war when another realm provokes them. At such times, some bad influences who look to enrich themselves with ransoms and pillage will clamor for retribution, and thus the damage caused by war to a monarch's treasury is less than the damage caused by doing nothing would be to his authority... I'm of course not talking about {s10}, as no one would ever question {reg4?her:his} authority
; dlga_mayor_war_description_3:mayor_war_description_4|I would stress again that we in the guild have nothing to do with politics. But if {s10} were to ask for my advice on these matters, as a loyal subject, I would tell {reg4?her:him} that while {reg4?her:his} claim is truly just, even the most legitimate claim must be backed by armed men, and armed men want money, and money comes from trade, and war ruins trade, so sometimes the best way to push a claim is not to push it, if you know what I mean...
; dlga_mayor_war_description_4:mayor_prepolitics|You may tell {s10} this if you see {reg4?her:him}. Don't mention my name specifically -- just say 'the people of {s4}' told you this. Our personal opinion, of course, as to what would be in {s10}'s best interests. None of us would ever dream of questioning a monarch's sovereign right to push {reg4?her:his} legitimate claims.
; dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_politics_assess|What is {s10}'s policy in regards to the other realms of this world?

; dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_internal_politics|What can you say about the internal politics of the realms?
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics:mayor_internal_politics_2|Well, here in the {s4} we are all united by our love for {s5} and support for {reg4?her:his} legitimate claim. But I have heard some talk of internal bickering in other realms...
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_2:mayor_internal_politics_3|The lords of a realm often have very different ideas about honor, strategy, and the way a nobleman should behave. In addition, they compete with each other for the ruler's favor, and are constantly weighing up their position -- how they stand, how their friends and family stand, and how their enemies stand.
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_3:mayor_internal_politics_4|Underlying all the tensions is the possibility that a lord may abandon his liege, and pledge vassalhood to another. In theory, each lord has sworn an oath of vassalage, but in practice, a vassal can always find an excuse to absolve himself. The vassal may claim that the liege has failed to hold up his end of the bargain, to protect the vassal and treat him justly. Or, the vassal may claim that his liege is in fact a usurper, and another has a better claim to the kingship.
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_4:mayor_internal_politics_5|Lieges and vassals still watch each other carefully. If a king believes that his vassal is going to change sides or rebel, he may indict the vassal for treason and seize his properties. Likewise, if a vassal fears that he will be indicted, he may rebel. Usually, whoever makes the first move will be able to control the vassal's fortresses.
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_5:mayor_prepolitics|Now, men do not trust a vassal who turns coat easily, nor do they trust a king who lightly throws around charges of treason. Those two factors can keep a realm together. But if relations between a vassal and a liege deteriorate far enough, things can become very tense indeed... In other lands, of course. These things could never happen here in the {s4}.
; dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_pretalk|That is all. Thank you.
; dlga_merchant_quest_about_job:merchant_quest_about_job_2|What about it?
; dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_what_if_fail|What if I can't finish it?
; dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_about_job_working|Well, I'm still working on it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_working:mayor_pretalk|Good. I'm sure you will handle it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_last_offered_job:merchant_quest_brief|Eh, you want to reconsider that. Good...
; dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk|I hope you don't fail. In that case, I'll have to ask for the price of the cargo you were carrying.
; dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk.1|Well, just do your best to finish it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I am counting on you then. Good luck.
; dlga_merchant_quest_stall:mayor_pretalk|Well, the job will be available for a few more days I guess. Tell me if you decide to take it.

; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief|Well, you look able enough. I think I might have something you could do.
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_looters_choice|We've had some fighting near the {s5} lately, with all the chaos that comes with it, and that's led some of our less upstanding locals to try and make their fortune out of looting the shops and farms during the confusion. A lot of valuable goods were taken. I need somebody to teach those bastards a lesson. Sound like your kind of work?
; dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_looters_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
; dlga_merchant_quest_looters_brief:close_window|Excellent! You'll find the looters roaming around the countryside, probably trying to rob more good people. Kill or capture the bastards, I don't care what you do with them. I'll pay you a bounty of 40 coins on every band of looters you destroy, until all the looters are dealt with.
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_explain_2|Well, there is a very great favor which you could do us... As you may have heard, some {s10}s have come across the border to attack our people. {s5} is under great pressure from some of the more bellicose of {reg0?her:his} vassals to respond with a declaration of war. Unfortunately, while the great lords of this land grow rich from bloodshed, we of the commons will be caught in the middle, and will suffer.
; dlga_merchant_quest_explain_2:merchant_quest_brief|We are not saying that {s5} should overlook this aggression -- far from it! But if {reg0?she:he} charges one of {reg0?her:his} own lords to respond, then the cycle of provocation will necessarily lead to a full-fledged confrontation. Now, if an outsider were to step in and defeat a {s10} lord in battle, then honor would be done, and it would defuse the clamor for war. If the defeated lord were a known troublemaker -- {s7} -- then the {s10}s might be able to overlook it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm|We need you to attack and defeat {s7}. This will not be an easy task, and that outsider would damage {his/her} relationship with the {s10}s, but we would be very grateful. We could not acknowledge a connection with that outsider, but we could be sure that {he/she} would be handsomely rewarded... Could you do this?
; dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief|Aye, I can do it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_pretalk|I would prefer not to get mixed up in such things
; dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice|The raiders are likely to have laid up their ships in a well-concealed cove, somewhere along the coastline, preferably next to a small stream where they have some water. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of sea raiders who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
; dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.1|Bandits such as these usually establish their hideouts in the foothills on the edge of the desert, often in a canyon near a spring. This gives them both water and concealment. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of desert bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
; dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.2|Bandits such as these will usually establish a base in the highlands, often on an steep ledge where they have a view of the surrounding countryside. This makes them difficult to surprise. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of mountain bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
; dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.3|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments deep in the woods, sometimes in the middle of a swamp. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of forest bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
; dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.4|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments in the woodland on the steppe, where they have some concealment. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of steppe bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
; dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.5|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments deep in the woods. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of tundra bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
; dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice:merchant_quest_destroy_lair_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice:lord_pretalk|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
; dlga_merchant_quest_destroy_lair_brief:close_window|Very good. We will await word of your success.
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.1|We have heard that {s4}, some travellers on the road {reg4?to:from} {s5} were attacked by {s7}.
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice|We would like you to track these {s4} down. The merchants of the town were able to get a description of their leader, and have put together a bounty. If you can hunt them down and destroy them, we'll make it worth your while...
; dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice:merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief:close_window|Very good. The band may not have lingered long in the area, but chances are that they will be spotted by other travellers on the road.
; dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.2|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to deliver some {s4}. Perhaps you can do that...
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine|I have a cargo of {s6} that needs to be delivered to the tavern in {s4}. If you can take {reg5} units of {s6} to {s4} in 7 days, you may earn {reg8} coins. What do you say?
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will make the delivery.
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I can't carry all that cargo now.
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.3|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to escort a caravan. Perhaps you can do that...
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief|I am going to send a caravan of goods to {s8}. However with all those bandits and deserters on the roads, I don't want to send them out without an escort. If you can lead that caravan to {s8} in 15 days, you will earn {reg8} coins. Of course your party needs to be at least {reg4} strong to offer them any protection.
; dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will escort the caravan.
; dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I don't have that many soldiers with me.

; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.4|Actually, I was looking for an able adventurer like you. There's this group of particularly troublesome bandits.

; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:troublesome_bandits_quest_brief|I will pay you {reg8} coins if you hunt down those troublesome bandits. It's dangerous work. But I believe that you are the {man/one} for it. What do you say?

; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.5|Actually, I was looking for an able adventurer like you. There's been a disturbing rise in the level of grain related crime recently.

; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.7|You may be able to help me. The local toughs are getting out of control here in town. They hang around the tavern all day, upsetting the customers and picking fights with any stranger who happens through. One of them is the cousin of an officer in the Town Watch, so my hands are tied.

; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:kidnapped_girl_quest_brief|The amount the bandits ask as ransom is {reg12} coins. I will give you that money once you accept to take the quest. You have 15 days to take the money to the bandits who will be waiting near the village of {s4}. Those bastards said that they are going to kill the poor girl if they don't get the money by that time.

; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1|This war between {s15} and {s14} has brought our town to the verge of ruin. Our caravans get raided before they can reach their destination. Our merchants are afraid to leave the safety of the town walls.

; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject|It is your duty to help the nobles in their war effort. You shouldn't complain about it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject:close_window|Hah. The nobles fight their wars for their greed and their dreams of glory. And it is poor honest folk like us who have to bear the real burden. But you obviously don't want to hear about that.
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3|There have been attempts to reconcile the two sides and reach a settlement. However, there are powerful lords on both sides whose interests lie in continuing the war. {reg0?They:These men} urge all others not to heed to the word of sensible men, but to keep fighting.

; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7|There is a way to resolve the issue. A particularly determined person can perhaps persuade one or both of these lords to accept making peace. And even if that fails, it can be possible to see that these lords are defeated by force and taken prisoner. If they are captive, they will lose their influence and they can no longer oppose a settlement... What do you think? Can you do it?

; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10|All right. I will do my best.

; dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_lumber_mission_2:village_elder_tell_deliver_lumber_mission_3|I think {reg5} bales of lumber will let us start building. We have plenty of keen villagers to help us with that.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_lumber_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_lumber_mission_accept|Then I will go and find you the lumber you need.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_lumber_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_lumber_mission_reject|I am afraid I don't have time for this. You'll need to find help elsewhere.

; dlga_village_elder_deliver_lumber_mission_reject:close_window|Yes, yes, of course. I am sorry if I have bothered you with our troubles.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission|We are suffering greatly at the hands of a group of bandits. They take our food and livestock, and kill anyone who doesn't obey them immediately. Our men are angry that we cannot defend ourselves, but we are only simple farmers... However, with some help, I think that some of the people here could be more than that. We just need an experienced warrior to teach us how to fight.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission:village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_accept|I can teach you how to defend yourself.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission:village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_reject|You peasants have no business taking up arms. Just pay the bandits and be off with it.
; dlga_village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_accept:close_window|You will? Oh, splendid! We would be deeply indebted to you, {s0}. I'll instruct the village folk to assemble here and receive your training. If you can teach us how to defend ourselves, I promise you'll receive everything we can give you in return for your efforts.
; dlga_village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_reject:close_window|Yes, of course {s0}.  Thank you for your counsel.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission|Bandits have driven away our cattle. Our pastures are empty. If we had just a few heads of cattle we could start to raise a herd again.

; dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission:village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_reject|I don't have time for this. Ask help from someone else.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_2:village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_3|I think {reg5} heads will suffice for a small herd.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_accept|Then I will bring you the cattle you need.

; dlga_goods_merchant_talk:trade_info_request|What goods should I buy here to trade with other towns?
; dlga_goods_merchant_talk:close_window|Nothing. Thanks.
; dlga_trade_info_request:trade_info_request_2|That information can be best obtained from caravan masters and travelling merchants. If you want I can send you to the district where foreign merchants stay at when they come to the town. If you spend some time there and listen to the talk, you can learn a lot about what to buy and where to sell it.
; dlga_trade_info_request_2:close_window|Then I'll go and spend some time with these merchants.
; dlga_trade_info_request_2:goods_merchant_pretalk|I have no time for this right now.

; dlga_arena_intro_1:arena_intro_2|Tourney? So they hold the tourneys here...
; dlga_arena_intro_2:arena_intro_3|Yes. You should see this place during one of the melee fights. Everyone from the town and nearby villages comes here. The crowd becomes mad with excitement. Anyway, as I said, there won't be an event here soon, so there isn't much to see. Except, there is an official duel every now and then, and  of course we have melee fights almost every day.
; dlga_arena_intro_3:arena_training_melee_intro|Tell me about the melee fights.
; dlga_arena_training_melee_intro:arena_training_melee_intro_2|The fighters and knights get bored waiting for the next melee, so they have invented the training melee. It is a simple idea really. Fighters jump into the arena with a weapon. There are no rules, no teams. Everyone beats at each other until there is only one fighter left standing. Sounds like fun, eh?
; dlga_arena_training_melee_intro_2:arena_training_melee_intro_reward|Is there a reward?
; dlga_arena_training_melee_intro_reward:arena_training_melee_intro_2|There is, actually. Some of the wealthy townsmen offer prizes for those fighters who show great skill in the fights. If you can beat {reg1} opponents before going down, you'll earn {reg11} coins. You'll get {reg12} coins for striking down at least {reg2} opponents, {reg13} coins if you can defeat {reg3} opponents, and {reg14} coins if you can survive long enough to beat {reg4} opponents. If you can manage to be the last {man/fighter} standing, you'll earn the great prize of the fights, {reg15} coins. Sounds good, eh?

; dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk|Ha-ha, that's quite the bruise you're sporting. But don't worry; everybody gets trounced once in awhile. The important thing is to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and keep fighting. That's what champions do.
; dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.1|Hey, you managed to take down {reg8} opponents. Not bad. But that won't bring you any prize money. Now, if I were you, I would go back there and show everyone what I can do...

; dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.3|That was a good fight you put up there. You managed to take down no less than {reg8} opponents. And of course, you earned a prize money of {reg10} coins.
; dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.4|Your performance was amazing! You are without doubt a very skilled fighter. Not everyone can knock down {reg8} people in the fights. Of course you deserve a prize with that performance: {reg10} coins. Nice, eh?
; dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.5|That was damned good fighting, {playername}. You have very good moves, excellent tactics. And you earned a prize of {reg10} coins for knocking down {reg8} opponents.
; dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.6|Congratulations champion! Your fight there was something to remember! You managed to be the last fighter standing beating down everyone else. And of course you won the grand prize of the fights: {reg10} coins.

I'm just a simple merchant, and if I've learned anything, it's that the merchants are the first to suffer in hard times. So, I am planning to travel to another country, peaceful and rainless, I hope. I have heard that in the Free Cities gold flows from watery fountains, so maybe I'll go try my fortune in Pentos or Volantis.
; dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_2:merchant_quest_1_prologue_3|Anyways, I advise you, before I leave, to do the same and seek your own fortune in other lands. War is sure to engulf the Seven Kingdoms, now that the Hand has been executed, and the people will be nothing more than war fodder. Poverty feeds on the weak, and the strong men abuse the sword and the lance to impose their power and control over the humble ones. In order to trade we must pay heavy taxes in each city, sort out bandits and pirates, and pray that a local lord, ignorant and lazy, do not decide to get half of our merchandise to fund his next feast or buy a new horse for his son.
; dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_3:merchant_quest_1a|But I am getting ahead of myself. Take my advice and go across the Narrow Sea. Until a new king has been crowned and anointed by the High Septon, law and unity will remain a vulture's feasting table. So I say, seek your destiny elsewhere.
