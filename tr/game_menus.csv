menu_start_game_options|Kral Robert'ın büyük bir boğa tarafından katledildiğini duyduğun sırada, Şehir sokaklarında yürüyüşe çıkıyorsun. Konuştuğun balık tüccarı sana Kral'ın Eli Eddard Stark'ın tahta el koyduğunu söylüyor! Ama kral Joffrey'nin danışmanları bunu engelliyor ve barış tekrar sağlanıyor. Fakat, birkaç gün sonra, yorgun görünen bir gezgin daha çok haberle geliyor. Lord Stark'ın hapse atılmasından sonra, Kuzeyli lordlar Lannisterlar'ı yenmek ve derebeylerini kurtarmak için güneye gitmiş. Kingslayer'ın ordusunu pusuya düşürüp, güçlerini gönderip Ser Jaime'yi ele geçirmişler, Riverrun kale kuşatması engellediklerinden sonra . Anında, tuhaf olaylar Joffrey'nin üzerine dönmeye başlamış ve artık şehri sokaklarda haykırılmıyormuş. Hızlı bir karar vererek, hemen dışarı fırlıyorsun, aceleyle bir hancıya yerini satıyorsun ve sadece en gerekli şeyleri yanına alıyorsun. Kendi kaderini kontrol ettiğini hissediyorsun... ve ne olursa olsun, iyi ameller seni bekliyor.

; menu_start_game_0|Welcome, adventurer, to A Clash of Kings, a modification based on the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series by George R. R. Martin for Mount and Blade: Warband version 1.143. Before beginning the game you must create your character. Remember that in the traditional medieval society depicted in this world, war and politics are usually dominated by male members of the nobility. That does not, however, mean that you should not choose to play a female character, or one who is not of noble birth. Male nobles may have a somewhat easier start, but women and commoners can attain all of the same goals -- and in fact may have a much more interesting, if more challenging, early game.

; menu_nightfort_mad_axe|Finishing your talk with the mad cook, you feel time shifting, and everything grows dark. As you regain your sense of being, you find yourself still in the Nightfort, but the sun has set, and it's the dead of night.

; menu_yunkai_ship_1|You board the ship heading for Yunkai, in Slaver's Bay. The crew is a ragged and filthy bunch, foul-mouthed and lice-ridden. Upon boarding, you catch a glimpse of the slaves manning the oars. Naked to the waist, they're chained together by the ankles. The oarmaster is a big fat lyseni, with a pale belly, who wield a large whip. When you hear the whip crack for the first time, the oars begin going up and down, and soon the Spicy Maiden is on her way.
; menu_yunkai_ship_2|As the ship sails on, you notice how the northern horizon becomes increasingly red and bright, almost like a sunset. You notice the crew muttering about demons, brimstone, and the cursed ruins of Valyria. Soon, the ship is engulfed in an unatural fog, and a sharp smell penetrates the air.
; menu_yunkai_ship_3|Sailing onwards, the ship soon leaves the Smoking Sea behind, and the mood of the crew lightens. As the ship passes the Isle of Cedars, a monkey somehow manages to climb onboard, and the crew takes this as an omen. Apparently, a monkey aboard signals the favor of R'hllor. The effect of their cheering startles the monkey, and the morale of the crew is raised even further when it throws its excrement at the captain.
; menu_yunkai|As the ship sails into the harbor of Yunkai, you notice a strong smell wafting off the city. It carries the usual smells of a great many people living together, sweat, smoke and shit, but with the additional scent of spices mixed in. As you step off the ship, you're quickly carried to the town square by the throng of people heading that same way.
