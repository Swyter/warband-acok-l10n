Of course you might not have the denars required to do so, but the moneylenders are known to have some spare change.
; qstr_{reg1}_people_live_i|{reg1} people live in {s1}. There are currently {reg2} acres of land available for cultivation to provide them with  food and other goods. You own {reg3} acres of land in this town. You currently owe the moneylenders of {s1} {reg4} denars. The interest rate is 20% and the contract period amounts  to 2 weeks. If you dont manage to pay off your debt until the deadline, the interest is raised to 40%. Buying an existing acre costs {reg9} denars, while it sells for {reg10} denars. Building a new one requires {reg11} denars. The rent paid to landowners currently accumulates to {reg13} denars per acre every 2 weeks and has to be collected in the town. Land wont be rented if a town is already well supplied.

However, despite your family's hardships,                                they afforded you a good education and trained you from childhood for the rigors of aristocracy and life at court.
; qstr_You_were_born_the_{r|You were born the {reg3?daughter:son} of travelling merchants,                                  always moving from place to place in search of a profit. Although your parents were wealthier than most                                  and educated you as well as they could, you found little opportunity to make friends on the road,                                living mostly for the moments when you could sell something to somebody.
; qstr_As_a_child_your_fami|As a child, your family scrabbled out a meagre living from your father's wages                                  as a guardsman to the local lord. It was not an easy existence, and you were too poor to get much of an                                education. You learned mainly how to defend yourself on the streets, with or without a weapon in hand.
; qstr_You_were_the_{reg3?d|You were the {reg3?daughter:son} of a family who lived off the woods,                                  doing whatever they needed to make ends meet. Hunting, woodcutting, making arrows,                                  even a spot of poaching whenever things got tight. Winter was never a good time for your family                                  as the cold took animals and people alike, but you always lived to see another dawn,                                though your brothers and sisters might not be so fortunate.
; qstr_a_dothraki|a dothraki
; qstr_You_were_a_child_of_|You were a child of the dothraki sea, born to a tribe of wandering nomads who lived                                  in great camps throughout the arid grasslands.                                  Like the other tribesmen, your family revered horses above almost everything else, and they taught you                                how to ride almost before you learned how to walk. 
; qstr_As_the_{reg3?daughte|As the {reg3?daughter:son} of a thief, you had very little 'formal' education.                                  Instead you were out on the street, begging until you learned how to cut purses, cutting purses                                  until you learned how to pick locks, all the way through your childhood.                                Still, these long years made you streetwise and sharp to the secrets of cities and shadowy backways.

; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood,                                  you were sent to live in the court of one of the nobles of the land.                                  There, your first lessons were in humility, as you waited upon the lords and ladies of the household.                                  But from their chess games, their gossip, even the poetry of great deeds and courtly love, you quickly began to learn about the adult world of conflict                                and competition. You also learned from the rough games of the other children, who battered at each other with sticks in imitation of their elders' swords.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood,                                  you apprenticed with a local craftsman to learn a trade. After years of hard work and study under your                                  new master, he promoted you to journeyman and employed you as a fully paid craftsman for as long as                                you wished to stay.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_g|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood,                                  you apprenticed to a wealthy merchant, picking up the trade over years of working shops and driving caravans.                                  You soon became adept at the art of buying low, selling high, and leaving the customer thinking they'd                                got the better deal.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_gr|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood,                                  you took to the streets, doing whatever you must to survive.                                  Begging, thieving and working for gangs to earn your bread, you lived from day to day in this violent world,                                always one step ahead of the law and those who wished you ill.

Although you sometimes went hungry, you became a skillful hunter and pathfinder in your trackless country.                                Your body too started to harden with muscle as you grew into the life of a warrior {reg3?woman:man}.
; qstr_{s1}^^_You_started_t|{s1}^^ You started to learn about the world almost as soon as you could walk and talk.                              You spent your early life as {s2}. {s3}
; qstr_Though_the_distincti|Though the distinction felt sudden to you,                                  somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.                                  When you were named squire to a noble at court, you practiced long hours with weapons,                                  learning how to deal out hard knocks and how to take them, too.                                  You were instructed in your obligations to your lord, and of your duties to those who might one day be your vassals.                                  But in addition to learning the chivalric ideal, you also learned about the less uplifting side                                  -- old warriors' stories of ruthless power politics, of betrayals and usurpations,                                of men who used guile as well as valor to achieve their aims.
; qstr_Though_the_distinctio|Though the distinction felt sudden to you,                                  somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.                                  You joined the tightly-knit circle of women at court, ladies who all did proper ladylike things,                                  the wives and mistresses of noble men as well as maidens who had yet to find a husband.                                  However, even here you found politics at work as the ladies schemed for prominence and fought each other                                  bitterly to catch the eye of whatever unmarried man was in fashion at court.                                  You soon learned ways of turning these situations and goings-on to your advantage. With it came the                                  realisation that you yourself could wield great influence in the world, if only you applied yourself                                with a little bit of subtlety.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction|Though the distinction felt sudden to you,                                  somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.                                  You set out on your own with nothing except the instrument slung over your back and your own voice.                                  It was a poor existence, with many a hungry night when people failed to appreciate your play,                                  but you managed to survive on your music alone. As the years went by you became adept at playing the                                drunken crowds in your taverns, and even better at talking anyone out of anything you wanted.

You found yourself as a student in the citadel of Oldtown,                                  where you studied economy, philosophy, and medicine.                                  But not all your lessons were learned in the lecture halls.                                  You may or may not have joined in with your fellows as they roamed the alleys in search of golden arbor wine, women, and a good fight.                                  However, you certainly were able to observe how a broken jaw is set,                                or how an angry townsman can be persuaded to set down his club and accept cash compensation for the destruction of his shop.

Heeding the call of the open road, you travelled from village to village buying and selling what you could.                                  It was not a rich existence, but you became a master at haggling even the most miserly elders into                                giving you a good price. Soon, you knew, you would be well-placed to start your own trading empire...

You pursued a career as a smith, crafting items of function and beauty out of simple metal.                                  As time wore on you became a master of your trade, and fine work started to fetch fine prices.                                With food in your belly and logs on your fire, you could take pride in your work and your growing reputation.

Dissatisfied with common men's desperate scrabble for coin, you took to your local lord's own forests                                  and decided to help yourself to its bounty, laws be damned. You hunted stags, boars and geese and sold                                  the precious meat under the table. You cut down trees right under the watchmen's noses and turned them into                                firewood that warmed many freezing homes during winter. All for a few silvers, of course.

Whether you yearn for some faraway place or merely for the open road and the                                freedom to travel, you could no longer bear to stay in the same place.

And fewer still would be willing to put their lives at risk for my cause.  But you didn't hesitate for a moment in throwing yourself at my enemies. We have gone through a lot together, and with God's help, we prevailed.  I will gladly accept you as both my {husband/wife} and co-ruler of the {s14}.

However, despite your family's hardships, they afforded you a good education and trained you from childhood for the rigors of aristocracy and life at court.
; qstr_You_were_born_the_{re|You were born the {reg3?daughter:son} of travelling merchants, always moving from place to place in search of a profit. Although your parents were wealthier than most and educated you as well as they could, you found little opportunity to make friends on the road, living mostly for the moments when you could sell something to somebody.
; qstr_As_a_child_your_famil|As a child, your family scrabbled out a meagre living from your father's wages as a guardsman to Lord Whent. It was not an easy existence, and you were too poor to get much of an education. You learned mainly how to defend yourself in brawls with the other guardsmens sons, with or without a weapon in hand.
; qstr_You_were_the_{reg3?da|You were the {reg3?daughter:son} of a family who lived off the woods, doing whatever they needed to make ends meet. Hunting, woodcutting, making arrows, even a spot of poaching whenever things got tight. Winter was a hard time for your family as the cold took animals and people alike, but you always lived to see another dawn, though your brothers and sisters where not so fortunate.
; qstr_You_were_a_child_of_t|You were a child of the great grass sea, born to a tribe of wandering nomads who lived in great camps throughout the arid grasslands. Like the other tribesmen, your family revered horses above almost everything else, and they taught you how to ride almost before you learned how to walk. 
; qstr_As_the_{reg3?daughter|As the {reg3?daughter:son} of a thief, you had very little 'formal' education. Instead you were out on the streets of the Free Cities, begging until you learned how to cut purses, cutting purses until you learned how to pick locks, all the way through your childhood.  Still, these long years made you streetwise and sharp to the secrets of cities and shadowy backways.
; qstr_A_{reg3?daughter:son|A {reg3?daughter:son} that nobody wanted, you were left to the faith as a baby, a foundling raised by the septons and silent sisters to their own traditions.  You were only one of many other foundlings and orphans, but you nonetheless received a lot of attention as well as many years of study in the sept library and before the statues of the Gods. They taught you many things. Gradually, faith became such a part of your life that it was no different from the blood coursing through your veins.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_grow|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you were sent to live in the court of old Lord Vance.  There, your first lessons were in humility, as you waited upon the lords and ladies of the household.  But from their card games, their gossip, even the poetry of great deeds and courtly love, you quickly began to learn about the adult world of conflict and competition. You also learned from the rough games of the other children, who battered at each other with sticks in imitation of their elders' swords.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_growi|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you apprenticed with a local craftsman from Duskendale to learn a trade. After years of hard work and study under your new master, he promoted you to journeyman and employed you as a fully paid craftsman for as long as you wished to stay.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_growin|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you apprenticed to a wealthy qarthene merchant, picking up the trade over years of working shops and driving caravans.  You soon became adept at the art of buying low, selling high, and leaving the customer thinking they'd got the better deal.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_growing|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you took to the streets, doing whatever you must to survive. Begging, thieving and working for gangs to earn your bread, you lived from day to day in this violent world, always one step ahead of the city watch and those who wished you ill.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_growing_|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you rode the great sea of grass on a horse of your own, learning the ways of the Dothraki.  Although you sometimes went hungry, you became a skillful hunter and pathfinder in your trackless country.  Your body too started to harden with muscle as you grew into the life of a nomad {reg3?woman:man}.

; qstr_As_a_{s12}_growing_o|As a {s12} growing out of childhood, you attached yourself to a troupe of wandering entertainers, going from town to town setting up mummer's shows. It was a life of hard work, selling, begging and stealing your living from the townsfolk who flocked to watch your antics. Over time you became a performer well capable of attracting a crowd.
; qstr_As_a_{s12}_growing_ou|As a {s12} growing out of childhood, you spent much of your life at court, inserting yourself into the tightly-knit circles of nobility.  With the years you became more and more involved with the politics and intrigue demanded of a high-born {s13}.  You could not afford to remain a stranger to backstabbing and political violence, even if you wanted to.
; qstr_As_a_{s12}_growing_out|As a {s12} growing out of childhood, you were trained and educated to perform the duties and wield the rights of a noble landowner. The managing of taxes and rents were equally important in your education as diplomacy and even personal defence. You learned everything you needed to become a lord of your own hall.
; qstr_As_a_{s12}_growing_out_|As a {s12} growing out of childhood, you were trained and educated to the duties of a noble {s13}. You learned much about the household arts, but even more about diplomacy and decorum, and all the things that a future husband might choose to speak of.  Truly, you became every inch as shrewd as any lord, though it would be rude to admit it aloud.
; qstr_As_a_{s12}_growing_out_o|As a {s12} growing out of childhood, you became a novice in the faith, the lowest rank on the way to obtaining the rank of Most Devout. Years of rigorous learning and hard work followed. You were one of several novices, performing most of the menial labour in the sept in addition to being trained for more holy tasks.  When you where on the verge of adulthood you were allowed to conduct your first service. After that you were no longer a novice {s12}, but a {s13} waiting to take your vows into the service of the Gods.
; qstr_{s1}^^_You_started_to|{s1}^^ You started to learn about the world almost as soon as you could walk and talk.  You spent your early life as {s2}. {s3}
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  When you were named squire to Ser Decimer Appleton at court, you practiced long hours with weapons, learning how to deal out hard knocks and how to take them, too.  You were instructed in your obligations to your lord, and of your duties to those who might one day be your vassals.  But in addition to learning the chivalric ideal, you also learned about the less uplifting side -- old warriors' stories of ruthless power politics, of betrayals and usurpations, of men who used guile as well as valor to achieve their aims.
; qstr_{reg3?daughter:man}|{reg3?daughter:man}
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  You left your old life behind to travel the roads as a mercenary, a bravo, guarding caravans for coppers or bashing in heads for silvers. You became a {s14} of the open road, working with bandits as often as against.  Going from fight to fight, you grew experienced at battle, and you learned what it was to kill.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_s|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  You signed on with a sellsword company and travelled far from your home. The life you found was rough and ready, marching to the beat of strange drums and learning unusual ways of fighting.  There were men who taught you how to wield any weapon you desired, and plenty of battles to hone your skills.  You were one of the charmed few who survived through every campaign in which you marched.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_su|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  You joined the tightly-knit circle of women at court, ladies who all did proper ladylike things, the wives and mistresses of noble men as well as maidens who had yet to find a husband.  However, even here you found politics at work as the ladies schemed for prominence and fought each other bitterly to catch the eye of whatever unmarried man was in fashion at court.  You soon learned ways of turning these situations and goings-on to your advantage. With it came the realisation that you yourself could wield great influence in the world, if only you applied yourself with a little bit of subtlety.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sud|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  You set out on your own with nothing except the instrument slung over your back and your own voice.  It was a poor existence, with many a hungry night when people failed to appreciate your play, but you managed to survive on your music alone. As the years went by you became adept at playing the drunken crowds in your taverns, and even better at talking anyone out of anything you wanted.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudd|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  You found yourself as a student in the citadel of Oldtown, where you studied economy, philosophy, and medicine.  But not all your lessons were learned in the lecture halls.  You may or may not have joined in with your fellows as they roamed the alleys in search of wine, women, and a good fight.  However, you certainly were able to observe how a broken jaw is set, or how an angry townsman can be persuaded to set down his club and accept cash compensation for the destruction of his shop.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudde|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  Heeding the call of the open road, you travelled from village to village buying and selling what you could.  It was not a rich existence, but you became a master at haggling even the most miserly elders into giving you a good price. Soon, you knew, you would be well-placed to start your own trading kingdom...
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  You pursued a career as a smith, crafting items of function and beauty out of simple metal.  As time wore on you became a master of your trade, and fine work started to fetch fine prices.  With food in your belly and logs on your fire, you could take pride in your work and your growing reputation.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  Dissatisfied with common men's desperate scrabble for coin, you took to your local lord's own forests and decided to help yourself to its bounty, laws be damned. You hunted stags, boars and aurochs and sold the precious meat under the table. You cut down trees right under the watchmen's noses and turned them into firewood that warmed many freezing homes during winter. All for a few silvers, of course.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_t|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  You packed your few belongings and went out into the world to spread the faith of the Seven. You preached to anyone who would listen, and impressed many with the passion of your sermons. Though you had taken a vow to remain in poverty through your itinerant years, you never lacked for food, drink or shelter; the hospitality of the peasantry was always generous to a rising {s13} of the Gods.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, relying upon your quick thinking and even quicker reflexes to get you through each day.  Dissatisfied with a simple life of laboring for coin, you took to your local streets intent on helping yourself to what you needed in order to survive.  You shun the standard laws of man and have chosen to live by whatever rules allow you to avoid the headsman's block.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You earned applause and silver in brutal contests against men and beasts and grew to crave both rewards. Drunk on the bloodlust of the cheering crowd, you learned to tease the opponent and draw out your fight before eventually seizing victory with savage flair. Your agile moves and flamboyant presence mark you as both warrior and artist.

; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_y|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and with that change came understanding that the strong have the right to take from the weak. You became part of a band of robbers and grew adept at the art of ambush. You learned how to wield, with some facility, whatever weapon your prey bequeathed to you. When times were good, you caroused and feasted like a king. When pickings were slim, you lived off the land or perfomed quick raids on small villages. You prided yourself on your adaptability and capacity for violence.
; qstr_a_slaver|a slaver
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_yo|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. By some strange twist of fate you joined a slave caravan as a guard and slowly grew competent at watching over crafty human cattle on long journeys across the face of Essos. Every so often, you had to raid isolated villages or chase down new livestock, and through these experiences grew accustomed to the blunt language of club and stick. Though your profession is tolerated, it is not particularly respectable, and so you became inured also to suspicion and derision.
; qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_wha|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.  Still, it was not a difficult choice to leave, with the rage burning brightly in your heart.  You want vengeance. You want justice. What was done to you cannot be undone, and these debts can only be paid in blood...
; qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_what|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.  All you can say is that you couldn't bear to stay, not with the memories of those you loved so close and so painful.

You're not even sure when your home became a prison, when the familiar became mundane, but your dreams of wandering have taken over your life.

; qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_what_ca|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.  To everyone else, it's clear that you're now motivated solely by personal gain.  You want to be rich, powerful, respected, feared.  You want to be the one whom others hurry to obey.  You want people to know your name, and tremble whenever it is spoken.  You want everything, and you won't let anyone stop you from having it...
; qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_what_cau|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.  Regardless, the intense faith burning in your soul would not let you find peace in any single place.  There were others in the world, souls to be washed in the light of God. Now you preach wherever you go, seeking to bring salvation and revelation to the masses, be they faithful or pagan. They will all know the glory of God by the time you're done...

; qstr_You_came_into_the_worl|You came into the world a {reg3?daughter:son} of declining nobility, owning only the house in which they lived. However, despite your family's hardships, they afforded you a good education and trained you from childhood for the rigors of aristocracy and life at court.
; qstr_As_a_child_your_family|As a child, your family scrabbled out a meagre living from your father's wages as a guardsman to the local lord. It was not an easy existence, and you were too poor to get much of an education. You learned mainly how to defend yourself on the streets, with or without a weapon in hand.
; qstr_{reg3?daughter:son}|{reg3?daughter:son}
; qstr_You_were_the_{reg3?dau|You were the {reg3?daughter:son} of a family who lived off the woods, doing whatever they needed to make ends meet. Hunting, woodcutting, making arrows, even a spot of poaching whenever things got tight. Winter was never a good time for your family as the cold took animals and people alike, but you always lived to see another dawn, though your brothers and sisters might not be so fortunate.
; qstr_You_were_a_child_of_th|You were a child of the dothraki sea, born to a tribe of wandering dothraki who lived in great camps throughout the arid grasslands. Like the other tribesmen, your family revered horses above almost everything else, and they taught you how to ride almost before you learned how to walk. 
; qstr_As_the_{reg3?daughter:|As the {reg3?daughter:son} of a thief, you had very little 'formal' education. Instead you were out on the street, begging until you learned how to cut purses, cutting purses until you learned how to pick locks, all the way through your childhood. Still, these long years made you streetwise and sharp to the secrets of cities and shadowy backways.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_growing_o|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you were sent to live in the court of one of the nobles of the land. There, your first lessons were in humility, as you waited upon the lords and ladies of the household. But from their cyvasse games, their gossip, even the poetry of great deeds and courtly love, you quickly began to learn about the adult world of conflict and competition. You also learned from the rough games of the other children, who battered at each other with sticks in imitation of their elders' swords.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_growing_ou|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you apprenticed with a local craftsman to learn a trade. After years of hard work and study under your new master, he promoted you to journeyman and employed you as a fully paid craftsman for as long as you wished to stay.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_growing_out|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you apprenticed to a wealthy merchant, picking up the trade over years of working shops and driving caravans. You soon became adept at the art of buying low, selling high, and leaving the customer thinking they'd got the better deal.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_growing_out_|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you took to the streets, doing whatever you must to survive. Begging, thieving and working for gangs to earn your bread, you lived from day to day in this violent world, always one step ahead of the law and those who wished you ill.
; qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_growing_out_o|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you rode the great grass sea on a horse of your own, learning the ways of the grass and the desert. Although you sometimes went hungry, you became a skillful hunter and pathfinder in this trackless country. Your body too started to harden with muscle as you grew into the life of a dothraki {reg3?woman:man}.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_you|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. When you were named squire to a noble at court, you practiced long hours with weapons, learning how to deal out hard knocks and how to take them, too. You were instructed in your obligations to your lord, and of your duties to those who might one day be your vassals. But in addition to learning the chivalric ideal, you also learned about the less uplifting side -- old warriors' stories of ruthless power politics, of betrayals and usurpations, of men who used guile as well as valor to achieve their aims.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_you_|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You joined the tightly-knit circle of women at court, ladies who all did proper ladylike things, the wives and mistresses of noble men as well as maidens who had yet to find a husband. However, even here you found politics at work as the ladies schemed for prominence and fought each other bitterly to catch the eye of whatever unmarried man was in fashion at court. You soon learned ways of turning these situations and goings-on to your advantage. With it came the realisation that you yourself could wield great influence in the world, if only you applied yourself with a little bit of subtlety.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_you_s|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You set out on your own with nothing except the instrument slung over your back and your own voice. It was a poor existence, with many a hungry night when people failed to appreciate your play, but you managed to survive on your music alone. As the years went by you became adept at playing the drunken crowds in your taverns, and even better at talking anyone out of anything you wanted.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_you_so|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You found yourself as a student in the citadel of Oldtown, where you studied economy, philosophy, and medicine. But not all your lessons were learned in the lecture halls. You may or may not have joined in with your fellows as they roamed the alleys in search of wine, women, and a good fight. However, you certainly were able to observe how a broken jaw is set, or how an angry townsman can be persuaded to set down his club and accept cash compensation for the destruction of his shop.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_you_som|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. Heeding the call of the open road, you travelled from village to village buying and selling what you could. It was not a rich existence, but you became a master at haggling even the most miserly elders into giving you a good price. Soon, you knew, you would be well-placed to start your own trading empire...
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_you_some|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You pursued a career as a smith, crafting items of function and beauty out of simple metal. As time wore on you became a master of your trade, and fine work started to fetch fine prices. With food in your belly and logs on your fire, you could take pride in your work and your growing reputation.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_you_somew|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. Dissatisfied with common men's desperate scrabble for coin, you took to your local lord's own forests and decided to help yourself to its bounty, laws be damned. You hunted stags, boars and geese and sold the precious meat under the table. You cut down trees right under the watchmen's noses and turned them into firewood that warmed many freezing homes during winter. All for a few silvers, of course.
; qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_what_caus|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.

They taught you many things. Gradually, faith became such a part of your life that it was no different from the blood coursing through your veins.

When you were named squire to one of Lord Whents knights, you practiced long hours with weapons, learning how to deal out hard knocks and how to take them, too.  You were instructed in your obligations to your lord, and of your duties to those who might one day be your vassals.  But in addition to learning the knightly ideal, you also learned about the less uplifting side -- old warriors' stories of ruthless power politics, of betrayals and usurpations, of men who used guile as well as valor to achieve their aims.

As the years went by you became adept at playing the drunken crowds in your taverns, and even better at talking anyone out of anything you wanted.

You found yourself as an acolyte in the Citadel of Oldtown, where you studied economy, philosophy, and medicine.  But not all your lessons were learned in the lecture halls.  You may or may not have joined in with your fellows as they roamed the alleys in search of wine, women, and a good fight. However, you certainly were able to observe how a broken jaw is set, or how an angry townsman can be persuaded to set down his club and accept cash compensation for the destruction of his shop.

Dissatisfied with common men's desperate scrabble for coin, you took to Lord Whents own forests and decided to help yourself to its bounty, laws be damned. You hunted stags, boars and aurochs and sold the precious meat under the table. You cut down trees right under the guardsmens noses and turned them into firewood that warmed many freezing homes during winter. All for a few silvers, of course.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_you_somewhere_alon|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  You packed your few belongings and went out into the world to spread the the message of the Seven-Pointed Star.

Though you had taken a vow to remain in poverty through your itinerant years, you never lacked for food, drink or shelter; the hospitality of the peasantry was always generous to a rising {s13} of the Seven.
; qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_you_somewhere_along|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, relying upon your quick thinking and even quicker reflexes to get you through each day.

You became part of a band of outlaws and grew adept at the art of ambush. You learned how to wield, with some facility, whatever weapon your prey bequeathed to you. When times were good, you caroused and feasted like a king. When pickings were slim, you lived off the land or perfomed quick raids on small villages. You prided yourself on your adaptability and capacity for violence.

; qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_what_caused_you|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer. Regardless, the intense faith burning in your soul would not let you find peace in any single place. There were others in the world, souls to be washed in the light of God.
