menu_start_game_0|Benvenuto nel mondo avventuroso di A Clash of Kings una mod basata sul 'Le Cronache del Ghiaccio e del Fuoco' serie di George R. R. Martin per Mount and Blade: Warband. Prima di cominciare a giocare devi creare il tuo personaggio. Ricorda che nella società tradizionale rappresentata nel gioco, guerra e politica erano normalmente dominate dai membri maschi della nobiltà. Questo però non impedisce che tu possa giocare con un personaggio femminile, o uno che non sia di nobile nascita. I maschi nobili possono avere un inizio facile, ma donne e uomini comuni possono raggiungere tutti gli obiettivi. E questo potrebbe rendere ancora più interessante il gioco.

; menu_port_1|King's Landing is extremely populous, but rather unsightly and dirty compared to other cities, especially due to the poorer smallfolks tendency to build shanty settlements outside the city. The harbor itself is very large, and sellswords, thieves and deserters can often be found on the docks.
mno_choice_1_2|Parti.
; menu_port_2|Duskendale lies off the coast of Blackwater Bay. Before the Conquest, it was, along with Maidenpool, the principal port on the eastern side of Westeros, but King's Landing has long since replaced it. South of the town is a rocky headland that shelters the harbor from the storms of the narrow sea and north of it rise chalk cliffs. A road runs beside the shore between the grey-green sea and low limestone hills. Fishing villages dot the road for miles.
; menu_port_3|The natural harbor close to Rook's Rest is grey cliffs, many of them scorched and blackened, a testimony to the dragonfire that scoured the area when the dragons Sunfyre and Meleys fought in the skies above Rook's Rest during the Dance of the Dragons.
; menu_port_4|Close to the Whispers lie an old and forgotten smuggler's cove, which nonetheless provides excellent anchorage. The cove lies beneath a jutting rock formation, containing the ancient ruins of a castle, and beneath the cliffs lie a beacon tower that has fallen off the protruding rocks.
; menu_port_5|Claw Isle is the northernmost of the isles that are scattered around Blackwater Bay. An old valyrian colony, the island is smaller than Dragonstone and Driftmark, and there is no volcanic activity, though vents of steam often erupt from the caves and coves scattered around the island, startling travellers new to the island. The populace consists mostly of smallfolk who make their living fishing the Narrow Sea, though some sell their services as sellswords, many of whom favor the bow.
; menu_port_6|The volcanic isle of Dragonstone contains many coves and natural harbors, perfect for anchoring galleons and smaller vessels. However, the island is often hit by summer storms raging from across the Narrow Sea, crashing the ships anchored there against the cliffs and rocks of the volcanic mountainside, as happened to the Targaryen fleet during Robert's Rebellion.
; menu_port_7|The port of Driftmark is the principal harbor for the ships anchoring at the island of Driftmark. During the reign of Lord Corlys Velaryon, the Sea Snake, the many ports of the island became the central shipping point for all commerce on the eastern shore of Westeros, eclipsing even King's Landing for a time.
; menu_port_8|Sharp Point is where many Andal invaders landed and the chief amongst them was Togarion Bar Emmon, known as Togarion the Terrible, who crowned his brother-in-law as King of Massey's Hook and went to war against the Storm King.
; menu_port_9|The island of Tarth is said to be very beautiful, with its mountains and waterfalls, its high meadows and shadowed vales. It is called the Sapphire Isle, for the striking blue seas in which it sits, and was once ruled by the Evenstar kings, who held dominion over the seas. The men and women of Tarth tell stories of the True Knight, Ser Galladon of Morne, and chivalry is held in high regard on the island.
; menu_port_10|The castle of Griffin's Roost lies surrounded by red stone cliffs on three sides, which descend into the stormy waters of Shipbreaker Bay. The land-facing approach is a long natural ridge called the Griffin's Throat, which descend unto a beach that provides excellent anchorage.
; menu_port_11|Greenstone is a small island to the east of the Rainwood. The Estermonts have a long tradition of sailing the seas, and the island was not conquered until Erich Durrandon, known as the Sailmaker, built a fleet to contest their dominion of the waves. The island contains no port, but there are plenty of coves.
; menu_port_12|As with the other islands making up the Stepstones, Bloodstone contains many hidden coves and beaches sheltered from the storms that blow across the Narrow Seas.
; menu_port_13|As with the other islands making up the Stepstones, Torturer's Deep contains many hidden coves and beaches sheltered from the storms that blow across the Narrow Seas.
; menu_port_14|As with the other islands making up the Stepstones, Redstone contains many hidden coves and beaches sheltered from the storms that blow across the Narrow Seas.
; menu_port_15|Tyrosh is far larger than the market towns of Westeros, being described by many travellers as boisterous and loud. At the mouth of its harbor lies the Bleeding Tower, where sellswords, thieves, slavers and corsairs congregate.
; menu_port_16|As with the other islands making up the Stepstones, Last Refuge contains many hidden coves and beaches sheltered from the storms that blow across the Narrow Seas.
; menu_port_17|The island of the Lovely Crag lies to the west of Lys, and is where many of the girls destined for the pleasure houses of Tyrosh and Myr are shipped out. The locals are more than willing to tell travellers how the island have gotten it's name, though anyone clever enough should be able to figure it out.
; menu_port_18|The port of Lys lies in a bay, surrounded by high cliffs where palms gently sway in the breeze. Reckoned the most beautiful city in the world, as well as the one with the most pleasant climate, the city was originally founded by valyrian dragonlords who wished for a retreat from the fires of the Freehold. The dragonlords oft slept with their concubines on the island, which has led to a strong valyrian streak in the native population.
; menu_port_19|The island of Wreckstone lies to the west of Lys, and like many islands in the area contain a plethora of caves and coves, excellent for ships to anchor in safely. First, however, they have to brave the many reefs and rocks that form a ring around the island. Many ships do not make it, giving the island its name.
; menu_port_20|The island of the Farthest Reef is surrounded by many reefs, giving the island its name, that break up the waves. The shores of the island are quiet, and provide excellent anchorage for ships travelling to or from Slaver's Bay.
; menu_port_21|Braavos is served by two main harbors. The Purple Harbor, in the north, is used by locals only, while the Ragman's Harbor in the west is where foreign ships are moored. All ships have to submit to inspection by the Sealord's customs officers at the Chequy Port. Scattered throughout the city are small wharves and landings for the fishermen and ferries.
; menu_port_22|The port of Lorath, also known as the Port of Mazes, lies in Lorath Bay, a place of tranquil but cold waters. The lorathi ply the Shivering Sea, trading with their colony of Morosh and the island of Ibben.
; menu_port_23|The origins of Myr are murky and shrouded in legend, but none can dispute that the city contain an excellent harbor. In it, travellers can buy everything their hearts desire..
; menu_port_24|Like all the islands making up the chain of islands known as the Three Sisters, Littlesister contains many coves and natural harbors, perfect for pirates and smugglers looking for a place to hide.
; menu_port_25|Like all the islands making up the chain of islands known as the Three Sisters, Sweetsister contains many coves and natural harbors, perfect for pirates and smugglers looking for a place to hide.
; menu_port_26|Like all the islands making up the chain of islands known as the Three Sisters, Longsister contains many coves and natural harbors, perfect for pirates and smugglers looking for a place to hide.
; menu_port_28|Like all the islands that make up the home of the ironborn, Blacktyde contains many natural harbors, coves and inlets, making for excellent anchorage.
; menu_port_29|Like all the islands that make up the home of the ironborn, Orkmont contains many natural harbors, coves and inlets, making for excellent anchorage.
; menu_port_30|Like all the islands that make up the home of the ironborn, Harlaw contains many natural harbors, coves and inlets, making for excellent anchorage.
; menu_port_31|Lordsport provides safe anchor for those who wish to reach the castle of Pyke. The town still bears the mark the army of Robert Baratheon left on it, when his army landed on the island of Pyke years earlier and razed the town to the ground.
; menu_port_32|Like all the islands that make up the home of the ironborn, Saltcliffe contains many natural harbors, coves and inlets, making for excellent anchorage.
; menu_port_33|Like all the islands that make up the home of the ironborn, Old Wyk contains many natural harbors, coves and inlets, making for excellent anchorage.
; menu_port_34|Like all the islands that make up the home of the ironborn, Great Wyk contains many natural harbors, coves and inlets, making for excellent anchorage.
; menu_port_36|The island of Fair Isle used to be the seat of of power of the Farman Kings. The lords of the island has always been the first defense against ironborn looking to raid the Westerlands, and the isle contains many natural harbors and coves where longships aplenty are anchored.
; menu_port_37|The Shield Islands where given to their current inhabitans by the greatest of the Gardener kings, Garth the Goldenhand, after he drove the ironborn back into the sea. The islands provide excellent coverage from storms, and the men of the islands are adept at fighting in longships against reavers and pirates.
; menu_port_38|The port town of Ryamsport is located on the Arbor, in close vicinity to the castle. The harbor is busy, with ships from all over the world plying their trade in the waters around the island, looking to buy the famed Arbor wines.
; menu_port_39|Gulltown is one of the principal ports of the Seven Kingdoms, and was the first town conquered by the Andal invaders.
; menu_port_40|Old Anchor is located east of Ironoaks, where the river flows into the Narrow Sea. During the Andal invasions, thousands of would-be conquerors landed at what would one day become Old Anchor, giving the location its name.
; menu_port_41|The Fingers are narrow peninsulas of the northeastern Vale of Arryn which extend out into the Narrow Sea and the Shivering Sea. Gull Point is windswept, treeless, bare and stony, but it is also where the first Andal invaders landed, and there are thousands of beaches and coves that provide excellent coverage from the storms ravaging the Narrow Sea.
; menu_port_42|The Fingers are narrow peninsulas of the northeastern Vale of Arryn which extend out into the Narrow Sea and the Shivering Sea. Upcliff, an old castle by the sea, is where the reputed sorceress Ursula Upcliff held her husbands as thralls and declared herself bride of the Merling King. The area around Upcliff is perfect for longships seeking a safe place to weather the storms of the sea, and a major route for travellers out of White Harbor.
; menu_port_43|The port city of White Harbor contains many sights. Seal Rock is a massive stone dominating the approaches to the Outer Harbor. It is crowned with a ringfort of weathered stones of the First Men that stood desolate and abandoned for centuries. The stone looms fifty feet above the waters, grey-green in color and seals often rest on it. The harbor itself is divided into the inner and outer harbors. The outer harbor is larger, but the inner harbor offers better anchorage and shelter by the city wall on one side and the looming mass of the Wolf's Den on another.
; menu_port_44|The wolfswood is a great forest that extends far and wide. In ancient days, the ironborn would often reave along the coast, despite the rocky cliffs wrecking many ships. The men of the Wolfswood learned to arm themselves, and in time threw the invaders back into the sea. The tradition still exists, and many younger sons sell their sword to the highest bidder, that they may keep their blade sharp and bloody in the absence of the men they derisively call 'squids'.
; menu_port_45|The Stony Shore is an area along the western edge of the North. It is sparsely populated with only a few fishing villages, but the coastline is dotted with coves and natural harbors. The ironborn have often made use of these anchorages to land and raid the villages.
; menu_port_46|Cape Kraken is an area along the western edge of the North. It is sparsely populated with only a few fishing villages, but the coastline is dotted with coves and natural harbors. The ironborn have often made use of these anchorages to land and raid the villages, carrying off and raping the women. This had lead to some maesters speculating that the people of Cape Kraken are closer kin to the ironborn than the northmen.
; menu_port_47|The coastline close by Seagard is known for its tranquil seas and white beaches, making it a perfect place to land longships. The ironborn have taken great advantage of this for centuries, landing their forces and raiding the Riverlands. Seagard itself was built to warn the surrounding area of approaching invaders, and contain a large keep called the Booming Tower, where a great bronze bell is rung to warn the smallfolk when reavers are sighted.
; menu_port_48|Lannisport is the third largest port in the Seven Kingdoms. Located where the Ocean Road and the River Road meet, the city is renowned for its goldsmiths and jewelry, and ships from all over the world call at the golden city of the Westerlands to exchange their goods for gold.
; menu_port_49|The Sunset Harbor is a small harbor placed at the mouth of the Mander, the large river that runs through the Reach. First built by Garland the Bridegroom, it was supposed to guard the Mander against ironborn invaders, but turned out to be inadequate for that purpose, and was soon replaced by the Shield Islands.
; menu_port_50|Oldtown is the grandest city in the Seven Kingdoms, though the inhabitans of King's Landing contest this fact. The town is by far the oldest, having been built by the First Men. Trading ships from all over Westeros, as well as the Summer Islands, the Free Cities and other places across the Narrow Sea, constantly crowd into its harbors, looking to share in the bounty of the Reach.
; menu_port_51|While no more than a town by the standards of the Free Cities, Sunspear is the closest the dornish have to a city, and the principal port of the region. Ships from Lys, Tyrosh, Volantis and the Summer Isles ply their trade here, buying lemons, spices, pottery and peppers in the many stalls spread across the docks.
; menu_port_52|The city of Volantis sits on a very deep harbor. The volantenes claim that the hundred isles of Braavos could be dropped into the harbor and disappear. Volantis spreads across the mouth of the Rhoyne and across the hills and marshes on both sides of the river, and it is the principal port in the south of Essos. Thousands of ships pass through each year, and many sellswords, whores, thieves and sorcerers sell their services at the docks.
; menu_port_53|The Disputed Lands contain many coves, natural harbors and long tranquil beaches, perfect for all kinds of ships looking to anchor in order to trade, invade, or simply rest.
; menu_port_54|The Sea of Myrth is a large sea that is situated along the western coast of Essos. To the north lies the Flatlands, to the south the Disputed Lands and to the west, the Narrow Sea. The area is well-known for its white beaches and blue waters, perfect for anchorage.
; menu_port_55|The port of Pentos lies on the Bay of Pentos off the Narrow Sea, with the Flatlands plains and Velvet Hills to the east. Spicelords dominate the city, and ships ply the waters around the city fishing for mackerel and tuna.
; menu_port_56|Braavos sprawls across a hundred islands in a vast lagoon, and the nearby mainland is mostly marshland, that nonetheless provide an opportunity for ships to transport travellers to and from the city, while making it impossible for an army to lay siege to the city.
; menu_port_57|The Shivering Sea is a frigid sea that begins beyond the Wall and extends east along the northern coast of Essos. The coastline is filled with jutting cliffs and protruding rocks, making it difficult to land and make anchorage, though there are also many excellent natural harbors.

; menu_port_61|Along the western coast of the Seven Kingdoms lie the Sunset Sea. Villages dot the coastline, many of them having sprouted up around coves and natural harbors that provide shelter from storms.
; menu_port_62|The Weeping Town is no true city nor much of a town, but it is the closest the Stormlands have to a port town. Ships seldom land there, but some few fishing vessels can be found, mostly docking to sell their catch of cod and shrimp.
; menu_port_63|The Kingswood is a large forest that lies across the Blackwater Rush from King's Landing, and although a few smallfolk live in the forest, it is mostly used as the kings private hunting ground. The shores are filled with steep cliffs and ships often wreck themselves when they try to land. A few natural harbors do exist however.
; menu_port_64|Saltpans has never been an important trading port but ships do call there from time to time, and the salt shipped out is widely sought after by merchants from Essos.
; menu_port_65|Maidenpool was once one of the principal ports on the eastern side of Westeros, only surpassed by Duskendale. However, it has been steadily declining through the years, with King's Landing and Gulltown having long ago eclipsed the port in importance.
; menu_port_66|The port of Aquos Dhaen lies in the Borderlands, the region fought over by Volantis and Lys for hundreds of years. Never one of the self-governed cities of Essos, Aquos Dhaen was ruled by a governor appointed by the Freehold of Valyria before the Doom.
; menu_port_67|As with the other islands making up the Stepstones, Grey Gallows contains many hidden coves and beaches sheltered from the storms that blow across the Narrow Seas.
; menu_port_68|Bear Island is a remote island within the Bay of Ice, south of the Frozen Shore. The island contains old gnarled oaks, tall pines and plenty of bears. Aside from a few crofters, the inhabitants of the island live along the coasts and fish the seas.

; menu_ninestars_1|You arrive at Ninestars, the seat of House Templeton. You spot craftsmen setting up the tourney field, farmers bringing in supplies for the lords and ladies, young knights and squires practicing in the fields, riding at rings and bludgeoning each other with blunt swords and maces. Outside the walls, merchants have set up pavilions and tents, selling everything from apple pies and large chunks of cheese, to finely crafted tourney helmets, swords and large jugs of ale.
; menu_ninestars_2|Leaving the castle, you notice a great spectacle down by one of the pavilions. A man-at-arms, a young squire and a knight, with a surcoat showing seven black stripes and nine stars, are beating a young man, while a young woman looks on, a horrified look on her face. Moving nearer, she runs to your side, asking for your help. It seems the knight fondled her, and the young man, her betrothed, protested. That is when the knight hit him in the face with a steel gauntlet, and the man-at-arms started kicking him. Suddenly, the squire turns around and yank the woman away, taking hold of her hand, and breaking her wrist. You decide to...

; menu_ninestars_trial_woods_failed|Ser Emrick and Ser Arreck smelled strongly of wine and ale, and must have been more than a little drunk. When you fell to the ground, they seem to have taken you for dead, as you've just woken up in the bushes beside the road. With a head that's like to split, you make your way down the road, only to find yourself close to Ninestars! You must have gone the wrong way!
; menu_bloodstone_haunt_failed|The pirates have knocked you out, but they appear to be quite drunk, and simply dump you into the ocean. You quickly regain consciousness and stagger unto dry land, just in time! As you turn around, you see the large fin of a great brown shark turn around and head back out towards deeper waters.
; menu_ninestars_trial_woods_success|You hide the bodies of Ser Emrick and Ser Arreck in the woods, hoping that they weren't followed by anyone from the castle, but not before looting their bodies. Then you turn back towards Ninestars, to mask your tracks in case men are sent after you.
; menu_bloodstone_haunt_success|The pirates lie dead at your feet. As you loot their camp, you find nothing of interest, except for a few coins and an old sword.
; menu_ninestars_3|As you start brawling with the men, guardsmen from the castle come running over, to break up the fight. Before they arrive, you manage to take a swing at the knight, and hit him right on the nose. Blood spurts forth, but in the meantime, the man-at-arms has managed to get his club ready, and hits you in the head, causing you to fall unconscious.
; menu_ninestars_4|As you wake up, you notice a dim light, and a moldy smell. Opening your eyes, you realise you're in some sort of dungeon. It feels like your head is being invaded by an army of aurochs, and your body is blue and yellow, covered in bruises. As you get to your feet, you hear voices outside the locked door and, trying to stand upright, you wait for the man outside to enter...
menu_ninestars_5|Appena Ser Alyn lascia la cella, cadi in un sonno senza sogni. Sei svegliato dal richiamo di un gallo, e abbastanza presto, le guardie vengono a prenderti per il processo.
; menu_ninestars_6|As the guards escort you to the great hall of Ninestars, you notice a mass of noble lords and ladies. The knights attending the tourney, their wives and companions, their squires and attendants, all have turned out to watch the trial. You can hear whispers, snickers and quiet conversation, but have no way of knowing whether they're directed at you, or at Ser Raymun who has already arrived, wearing a doublet of yellow and black, and sporting a red, swollen, nose. As you make your way towards the dais where the three judges are seated, you see Ser Alyn smiling at you, but the two other judges scowl as if a nasty smell has followed you into the room. Ser Emrick and Ser Arreck Templeton, twins by the look of them, both have the look of warriors, broad shoulders, thick necks and flat bellies.
menu_ninestars_7|All'inizio del processo, i giudici vi chiedono se avete qualcosa da dire. Decidi di...
; menu_ninestars_8|As Ser Raymun lays his case before the judges, he starts to smirk. As he tells his tale of how you attacked him with no provocation, his eyes meet yours, and his smile grows wider. His tale contains a bit of truth, and with the two judges being his older brothers, you chances seem slim. Soon, the judges retreat to discuss the evidence laid before them, and all you can do is wait.
; menu_ninestars_9|As the judges return, you wait with baited breath. Ser Alyn, as the most senior of the judges, rises and pronounces the sentence. You won't lose a hand, he declares, but you'll receive fifty lashes for striking a relative of the local liege. The sentence is to be carried out immediatly, and the guards quickly surround you and drag you to the castle courtyard, where a big farmer stands ready with a whip. As the first lash strikes your back, you decide not to make a sound, but once the fifth strikes you, you forget all about your decision and the rest of the lashes fall to the sound of your screams.
; menu_ninestars_10|Once all the lashes have fallen, the local maester rushes to your side, taking you to his tower and giving you milk of the poppy. You quickly lose conscience, and when you wake up, hours have gone by. The maester tells you he's done all he can, and that you'll probably live, but that you lost a lot of blood and will likely feel the effect of the lashes for the rest of your life.

The maester tells you he's done all he can, and that you'll probably live, but that you lost a lot of blood and will likely feel the effect of the lashes for the rest of your life. He also informs you that you've been banned from the castle, and is to leave as soon as you can walk. As the victor of the fight, Ser Raymun would usually be the new owner of your arms and armor, but as you loaned it from Ser Alyn, he'll receive nothing. The equipment was damaged and dented during the fight though, and Ser Alyn has taken some coin out of your belongings to pay for the repairs.
; menu_ninestars_11|The hall immediatly erupts into chaos, with knights and squires shouting, ladies gasping, servants clapping, Ser Raymun and his two brothers seething and Ser Alyn favoring you with a big grin. The guards look confused, unsure of what to do, until Ser Alyn calls for quiet. He declares a request for trial by combat within your rights, and that the gods will surely look upon the righteous with favor. When Ser Raymun asks if you will still lose a hand, when he defeats you and if decides to accept your yield, Ser Alyn decrees that the loser will receives fifty lashes. When the guards gather around you to escort you back to your cell, Ser Alyn tells them to stop, and instead bring you to his chambers.
; menu_ninestars_12|As the guards escort you to the castellans chambers, you notice some knights nodding their approval of your actions. It would seem Ser Raymun is not well liked.
; menu_ninestars_13|As you lie down to sleep, you ponder how to defeat Ser Raymun. Soon, however, sleep overwhelms you, and suddenly dawn has arrived. Once again, the rooster wakens you, and Ser Alyn arrives with a servant carrying a plate with two sausages, three fried ducks eggs, a piece of new bread, fresh from the oven and a large piece of blood pudding. When you finish, the servants presents you with the armor provided by Ser Alyn, and helps you don it. He explains that Ser Raymun has asked for the trial to be fought on horseback, both of you starting with lances, and fighting on foot should either of you be struck from the saddle. Too soon, the servant tells you that the time has come, and you both descend the stairs of the keep, and begin walking towards the tourney ground.
; menu_ninestars_14|As you reach the tourney ground, smallfolk surrounds you. Grizzled old farmers shake your hand, and young peasant girls kiss your cheek. Young men pat your back, and a septon pushes through the crowd to bless you. You climb over the fence separating the tourney grounds and the surrounding fields, and mount your stallion. On the opposite end of the field, Ser Raymun is mounted on his own horse, holding a lance.
; menu_ninestars_trial_failed|As you regain your senses, you can see Ser Raymun standing over you. You notice his lips moving, but can't make out the words. He leans forward, and shouting into your face, asks if you yield. You manage to get a 'yes' through your bloody teeth, and Ser Raymun smirks at you, obviously pleased with himself. Rolling unto your side, you see the crowds sulking, obviously displeased with the result, and your performance. Some of the smallfolk have already started making their way away from the grounds, and a pair of noble ladies are giggling and pointing at you.
; menu_citadel_barrow_failed|You soon regain you senses, but see that the cultist has left the area. Your quest ends here.
; menu_citadel_barrow_success|The crazed cultist lies slain at your feet. You search the area for clues to what maester Cadwyn saw or found when he was in the area, but find nothing. The dead tree at the top of the hill is interesting though. On the stone in front of it is written the name 'YGG' in what can only be blood, and you can almost hear a faint whisper coming from somewhere. It's almost like it's coming from the tree.
; menu_ninestars_trial_failed_1|Soon, guards come to drag you to your cell, where they inform you that you'll receieve your punishment the next day. Despondent and tired, you fall asleep, and all too soon, the sun rises once again. The door to the cell is opened, and guards quickly surround you and drag you to the castle courtyard, where a big farmer stands ready with a whip. As the first lash strikes your back, you decide not to make a sound, but once the fifth strikes you, you forget all about your decision and the rest of the lashes fall to the sound of your screams.
; menu_ninestars_trial_success|As Ser Raymun falls to the ground, the stands erupt in cheers, and the smallfolk surrounding the tourney grounds shout your name. Blood leaking through his armor, Ser Raymun gives a final sigh, and then breathes his final breath. Exhausted yourself, you motion for a servant to help you get out of your armor and back into some comfortable clothes.
; menu_ninestars_trial_success_1|Suddenly, Ser Alyn appears at your side, taking hold of your arm and dragging you off towards the the woods. Still groggy from the fight, you can't make sense of what he's shouting, but then he points towards the castle gates. There, Ser Emrick and Ser Arreck are mounting their horses, and grabbing swords, obviously intending to revenge their little brother. Ser Alyn leads you towards the road leading towards Snakewood, and tells you to make haste, before the brothers can catch up to you. As a final gesture, with a broad smile on his face, he hands you a small bag, filled with clinking coins. 'I bet a good amount on you defeating Ser Raymun, and figured it was only just you should have your share' he says.
; menu_ninestars_trial_success_2|Setting out, you make good speed towards the safety of Snakewood, but the brothers are mounted on fine horses, and they know the woods much better than you do. Soon, you can hear them coming up behind you, and you turn your horse around, ready to face them.
; menu_bloodstone_haunt|Nearing the camp of the pirates, you can soon see the shapes of tents huddling around the abandoned ruins of a long-destroyed castle. You notice that the earth around you is oddly barren, almost as if it's been scorched by fire hot enough to eradicate all signs of life and melt the uppermost layer to a hard crust.
; menu_ninestars_15|In the stands surrounding the tourney grounds, knights, nobles, ladies, farmers and merchants are gathered. A septon is summoned to deplore the Father above to give strenght to the righteous and judge the men about to fight justly. A herald blows a trumpet, the signal to fight, and you tighten your grip on the horse.
menu_castle_black|Sei arrivato a Castello Nero, la roccaforte dei Guardiani della Notte.
; menu_citadel_septry|You arrive at a lonely septry, in the most remote part of the Vale, where the waters of the Neck dissipate. The countryside is barren and windswept, and only a few poor peasants make their home here, close to the mountains.
; menu_citadel_holdings|You arrive at an old holdfast, the seat of Ser Elston. The structure is ancient, perched on the top of a looming hill, overlooking a minor village. The villagers eye you sullenly as you pass by, many of them looking oddly alike, until you realise that many of them are probably related. The air is somehow thick, and in the distance you can almost make out an old forest, the trees tall and gnarled, reaching for the sky.
; menu_citadel_barrow|Your journey to the barrow was harrowing. The ground in the area is squishy, watery and smells rotten. Vapors seep from the trees, many of them fallen over or moulding, and wildlife is almost non-existant, except for a few rats scurrying across your path. The barrow rises ahead of you, a cluster of stones on top of a hill, though much of the area is submerged in water. The air is putrid, filled with miasmas and all kinds of foul smells, and thick, somehow thick.

Al momento dell'imbarco, intravedi degli schiavi imbracciare i remi. Nudi fino alla cintola, sono incatenati insieme per le caviglie. Il mastro di remi è un grande e grasso lysiano, con la pancia pallida, che sventola una larga frusta.

L'uomo è scosso da tremiti mentre descrive i loro occhi malefici, le loro armature nere e dorate, i loro elmi ornati con draghi, grifoni e teschi.

A woman standing close by recounts the rumor, something she picked up in a tavern not far from your location.

During the Lyseni Spring, the Rogare Bank rivaled the Iron Bank of Braavos, but following the fall of Lysaro Rogare, the family lost much of their influence.
