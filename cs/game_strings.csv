It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you fare poorly in several desperate attempts to start adventuring again. You end up a beggar in {s9}, living on alms and the charity of the church.
; str_retirement_text_2|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save.

; str_retirement_text_3|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you end up a penniless drifter, going from tavern to tavern blagging drinks from indulgent patrons by regaling them with war stories that no one ever believes.
; str_retirement_text_4|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but you manage to put together enough to buy some land near the village of {s7}. There you become a free farmer, and you soon begin to attract potential {wives/husbands}. In time the villagers come to treat you as their local hero. You always receive a place of honour at feasts, and your exploits are told and retold in the pubs and taverns so that the children may keep a memory of you for ever and ever.
; str_retirement_text_5|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but it's enough to buy a small tavern in {s9}. Although the locals are wary of you at first, they soon accept you into their midst. In time your growing tavern becomes a popular feasthall and meeting place. People come for miles to eat or stay there due to your sheer renown and the epic stories you tell of your adventuring days.
; str_retirement_text_6|You've saved wisely throughout your career, and now your silver and your intelligence allow you to make some excellent investments to cement your future. After buying several shops and warehouses in {s9}, your shrewdness turns you into one of the most prominent merchants in town, and you soon become a wealthy {man/woman} known as much for your trading empire as your exploits in battle.
; str_retirement_text_7|As a landed noble, however minor, your future is all but assured. You settle in your holdfast at {s7}, administrating the village and fields, adjudicating the local courts and fulfilling your obligations to your liege lord. Occasionally your liege calls you to muster and command in his campaigns, but these stints are brief, and you never truly return to the adventuring of your younger days. You have already made your fortune. With your own hall and holdings, you've few wants that your personal wealth and the income of your lands cannot afford you.
; str_retirement_text_8|There is no question that you've done very well for yourself. Your extensive holdings and adventuring wealth are enough to guarantee you a rich and easy life for the rest of your days. Retiring to your noble seat in {s8}, you exchange adventure for politics, and you soon establish yourself as a considerable power in your liege lord's realm. With intrigue to busy yourself with, your own forests to hunt, a hall to feast in and a hundred fine war stories to tell, you have little trouble making the best of the years that follow.

; str_npc2_intro|Hello. Would you be so kind as to have a cup with me? I'm down to my last bit of coin and I'd rather not drink alone.
; str_npc3_intro|Good day to you!
; str_npc4_intro|I am Graznon zo Paton, son of Grazhnak zo Paton, who was son of Graznon zo Paton of the most ancient and magnificent House of Paton, of the majestic city of Astapor.
; str_npc5_intro|Greetings, fellow traveller. Would you join me for a mug of stout ale?
; str_npc6_intro|Hello there. You look like an able warrior, you wouldn't be needing company by any chance?
; str_npc7_intro|Yes? Keep your distance, by the way.
; str_npc8_intro|What do you want?
; str_npc9_intro|You there, be so kind as to fetch me another drink, eh?
; str_npc10_intro|Greetings there, friend. Might I interest you in a game of cyvasse?
; str_npc11_intro|Hello there, friend. Have a drink on me.
; str_npc12_intro|Greetings, fellow traveller. By any chance, could you offer me a helping hand, by the kindness of your heart?
; str_npc13_intro|Greetings, traveller. I am Ser Roger Osgrey, a knight, and a son of Standfast.
; str_npc14_intro|Yes? What do you want?
; str_npc15_intro|Oh! Say, friend, are you by chance heading out of town anytime soon?
; str_npc16_intro|Hello there. From the look of you, I'd say you're expecting to get into some fights in the near future. Are you by any chance looking for some help?
; str_npc17_intro|Oh how he flew so high! And fell so low! Then he died! And how the worms gorged on him!

; str_npc1_intro_response_1|Well met, Ser Bennis. What is an anointed knight doing in a filthy tavern such as this?

; str_npc3_intro_response_1|Good day.
; str_npc4_intro_response_1|I have never heard of the House of Paton.
; str_npc5_intro_response_1|Certainly. With whom do I have the pleasure of drinking?
; str_npc6_intro_response_1|Might be, who are you?
; str_npc7_intro_response_1|My apologies. Might I know who I am speaking to?
; str_npc8_intro_response_1|Merely to pass the time, if you're not otherwise engaged. Will you join me for a drink.

; str_npc12_intro_response_1|That depends...
; str_npc13_intro_response_1|Well met, Ser Roger. What does a noble knight of Standfast find himself doing in a tavern such as this?
; str_npc14_intro_response_1|To pass the time of day with a fellow traveller, if you permit.
; str_npc15_intro_response_1|I am. What concern is it of yours, may I ask?

; str_npc23_intro_response_1|Thank you, my lady. Can you tell me about yourself?

; str_npc4_intro_response_2|Eh? No thanks, I'm full.
; str_npc5_intro_response_2|I have no time for that.
; str_npc6_intro_response_2|No, I do not.
; str_npc7_intro_response_2|Right. I'll not bother you, then.
; str_npc8_intro_response_2|Nothing at all, from one so clearly disinclined to offer pleasantries. Good day to you.
; str_npc9_intro_response_2|Fetch it yourself!
; str_npc10_intro_response_2|I'm busy, and have no time for games.
; str_npc11_intro_response_2|I think not.
; str_npc12_intro_response_2|Sorry, I am afraid that I am otherwise engaged right now.
; str_npc13_intro_response_2|Well... how... splendid.
; str_npc14_intro_response_2|Nothing at all. My apologies.
; str_npc15_intro_response_2|I'd be obliged if you minded your own business.
; str_npc16_intro_response_2|Mind your own business.
; str_npc17_intro_response_2|Very well then.
; str_npc18_intro_response_2|I'm not protecting a stranger. Be gone.
; str_npc19_intro_response_2|Well then, good day to you.
; str_npc20_intro_response_2|Nothing, I'm sorry to bother you.
; str_npc21_intro_response_2|I imagine praying to the Stranger would be more fitting, seeing as how you insult your betters.
; str_npc22_intro_response_2|I'm sorry, I won't bother you again.
; str_npc23_intro_response_2|I'll mind the drunkards.
; str_npc24_intro_response_2|Nevermind.
; str_npc25_intro_response_2|Right...
; str_npc26_intro_response_2|Nothing.
str_npc27_intro_response_2|Ah, tak nic.
str_npc28_intro_response_2|Nic.
; str_npc1_backstory_a|Well, it's a ponderous tale...
; str_npc2_backstory_a|It's quite the tragic tale. Sit down, sit down! No point standing up.
; str_npc3_backstory_a|You look like a man of war, do you by any chance need a young squire?
; str_npc4_backstory_a|Really? Well, perhaps you can be forgiven, being the savage mongrel that you are. Our ancestral lands lie far to the east, in Slaver's Bay.
; str_npc5_backstory_a|I am Ser Felton Flowers, the former master-of-arms at the Eyrie.
; str_npc6_backstory_a|I am Martyn Snow, a bastard born in the North. I am also a sellsword, which is ever more important than my birth.
; str_npc7_backstory_a|You have the honor of speaking to Ser Jasper Rivers, son of Ser Stevron Frey, trueborn son of lord Walder Frey, the Lord of the Crossing.
; str_npc8_backstory_a|Ah. Well, that sounds rather good. I shall gladly join you. You're paying.
; str_npc9_backstory_a|My most humble apologies. It is sometimes hard to recognize folk amid the smoke and gloom here. I still cannot believe that I must make my home in such a place. What a horrible fate that has befallen me!
; str_npc10_backstory_a|Oh well, a shame, I find that the game keeps my mind sharp. Say, do you by any chance need a an officer in your company? I find myself without an opportunity to make use of my considerable lungs, shouting at maggots to fall back in line.
; str_npc11_backstory_a|Why, I won the archery competition held by lord Hightower last year, and I have been drinking my way across the world ever since!
; str_npc12_backstory_a|I shall tell you -- but know that it is a tale of gross iniquity. I warn you in advance, lest you are of a choleric temperament, and so become incensed at the injustice done unto me that you do yourself harm.
; str_npc13_backstory_a|I am the fifth son of my father, Ser Edwyn, and as such, it seems to me being somewhat unlikely that I will ever inherit anything of value. So I have been travelling the world these last eight months, trying to find a noble lord to whom I might swear allegiance.
; str_npc14_backstory_a|Very well. I do not mind. My name is Drollo.
; str_npc15_backstory_a|I'm an engineer, trained in the great city of Braavos, and I specialize in fortifications. If you need a wall knocked down, I can do that, given enough time. If you need a wall built back up, I can do that too, although it will take longer and cost you more. And you can't cut costs, either, unless you want your new edifice coming down underneath you, as someone around here has just found out.
; str_npc16_backstory_a|Well, as long as I can remember I've had a weakness for pretty things, and it's gotten me into trouble, you see.
; str_npc17_backstory_a|Oh never mind me, I was just in the middle of composing a voluptous poem about the illustrious high steward of Qohor, Logon Votyris, a lowborn leech-catcher who rose to his position during the reign of the tyrant Byan Mentarios.
; str_npc18_backstory_a|My father, my brother, the village elder... Everyone! They have been searching for me ever since I ran away. I'm telling you, I'm innocent, not every bastard is evil!.
; str_npc19_backstory_a|Ah, my humble apologies, I quite forgot that not everyone speaks the exalted language of my great home.
; str_npc20_backstory_a|What every soldier alone does, I'm looking for employment.
; str_npc21_backstory_a|Oh, I am the greatest of sinners! Descended from a great line of sinners! House Parren was once pious and just, until my dishonorable ancestor travelled to Lys with Aerion Brightflame in his exile. When Aerion died from drinking wildfire, my forefather dipped the servants in the same substance and was responsible for the great fire that destroyed the western quarter of the city.
; str_npc22_backstory_a|It's those blasted knights... They ruined everything!
; str_npc23_backstory_a|I could, I could! But I'm sure my mother would be much more informative than me. I've always been more of a fighter than a scholar, just like all the other women of my family. We're too busy fending off men to pick up anything but an axe.
; str_npc24_backstory_a|People call me Roddy. Or, well, people in King's Landing does. Used to be everyone in King's Landing knew my name. 'There goes Roddy' they'd say, 'bravest man in all of the city watch'. Then that vicious son of a whore, Tywin Lannister, came and sacked the city. Told Aerys he came as a friend, then turned his cloak and betrayed his king. Bah!
; str_npc25_backstory_a|BLOOD SO RED! SO RED! So sweet, sweet screams, pretty screams, singing screams, scream your song, sing your screams...
; str_npc26_backstory_a|I am Caul, former chieftain of the Red Sparrows.
; str_npc27_backstory_a|Hah, I'm just yanking your tail, ain't pondering anything. Bit drunk though. But ah, what can I do for you? People call me Melly Waterman, because, well, it's my name.
; str_npc28_backstory_a|Who's asking? Did she send you, the whore? Tell her that I'm not interested. Wandering across half the world like some sun-mad camel is what she had me doing! Bah!
; str_npc1_backstory_b|I competed in the great tourney at Harrenhal, ages ago, in what some call 'The Year of the False Spring'. How the armor of the knights and lords shone that day, with none brighter than the Prince of Dragonstone! Prince Rhaegar was unstoppable, but I also acquitted myself well. However, in my last joust, I accidently killed the nephew of old lord Vance. There is no greater dishonor for a knight, and every lord and lady in the realm saw me that day.
; str_npc2_backstory_b|I was on my way to Pentos, out of King's Landing, with a cargo of spices and peppers from Dorne. I owned my own trading vessel in those days, a beautiful galleon with a figurehead showing the Maiden. We lay in at Dragonstone for water, when I was accosted by Stannis Baratheons castellan, a Florent if I ever saw one. Those ears! Anyhow, he comes and tells me that my ship is now in the service of the king. It seems Stannis is amasing an army on Dragonstone, and in order to transport it, he needs every single ship he can get his hands on. They emptied my hulls and gave me a slip of paper promising to pay me for my losses once Stannis comes into his kingdom. Much good that'll do me now.
; str_npc3_backstory_b|I used to squire for Ser Halbert Stone, of Willow Tree, but he died of the bloody flux, and I know no other trade.
; str_npc4_backstory_b|My family is one of the most prominent of Astapor, or rather was. A dragon has descended on the city and burned the Good Masters! I was on my way to Volantis when I heard about it, and I have been moving ever westwards since. Proud my people might be, but I am no fool. I know my history. Five times, the Ghiscare Empire challenged the Freehold of Valyria, and five times my great ancestors where humbled and, in the end, they where burned. Legions of soldiers are no match for dragons.
; str_npc5_backstory_b|I was promoted shortly after lord Jon left to take up his position as Hand of the King in King's Landing. With most of his household following him, the Eyrie did, in truth, not need a master of arms. But who was I to question Jon Arryns wisdom. It payed well, it was a position of fair respect for a man bastard born, and I did not want for nothing.
; str_npc6_backstory_b|I have served for some time with the Second Sons, so I am no stranger to battle. But now I seek to make my fortune, and that does not happen as a mere man-at-arms in a sellsword company.
; str_npc7_backstory_b|My father has sent me out to gain some experience in the service of a master other than my lord grandfather, that I may increase the honor of our house, or so my brother Ryman told me.
; str_npc8_backstory_b|I suppose you want my story, eh? I do not intend to tell you anything.
; str_npc9_backstory_b|I was the firstborn son of my father, a nobleman of Pentos. But my mother died in childbirth, and when I was but ten, my father remarried. His new wife soon mothered many a child, and conspired to have me replaced as my fathers heir. When my younger brother died, she told my father I had pushed him off the balcony! Bah!, the fool probably climbed unto the damned thing himself.
; str_npc10_backstory_b|I used to command the household guard of Ser Boros Wensington, but he died without an heir and when his holdfast was inherited by his relatives, they appointed a new captain of their guard. I imagine my rugged good looks and, perhaps more so, my dornish heritance might have had something to do with it. I've spent the last year playing cyvasse, waiting for someone worthy to cross my path.
; str_npc11_backstory_b|I bested Ser Rolland Storm, the Bastard of Nightsong! A genial man, he even congratulated me afterwards! I heard he's recently taken service with lord Stannis, or King Stannis as he calls himself now. Perhaps I ought to seek him out, see if he'd like to have a rematch!
; str_npc12_backstory_b|I am by training a maester of the Citadel, but condemned by the jealousy of the thick-headed Archmaesters of my brotherhood to make my living as an itinerant barber. I was hired by a merchant of Ashford to cure his son, who fell into a coma after a fall from his balcony. I successfully trepanned the patient's skull to reduce the cranial swelling, but the family ignored my advice to treat the ensuing fevers with a tincture of willow bark, and the boy died. The father, rather than reward me for my efforts, charged me with sorcery -- me, a maester of the Citadel! Such is the ignorance and ingratitude of mankind.
; str_npc13_backstory_b|It has become a bit of a tradition that the youngest sons in the Osgrey family ride out on the day they receive their knighthood, my family has proven itself to be quite a fertile one, heh! I have uncles and great-uncles, nephews and brothers in abundance. Might be old Walder Frey has fathered a brood that could rival that of a dozen cats, but my father is half his age, and likely to outbreed him! My elder brothers, Ademar and Duncan, are to inherit Standfast and Coldmoat, Duncan holding Coldmoat in Ademars name. And my sister, Rohanna, has been promised to Ser Alyn Ladybright, and thus stands to one day be the Lady of Brightfast! But that leaves little for my fathers remaining children, so we must make our own fortune.
; str_npc14_backstory_b|I am the second son of the Khal Ogo, of whom you have no doubt heard. I came to Volantis to train men in the art of battle. I told one of the triarchs it was wiser to flog their slave soldiers now, then bury them later, than sending them against an enemy. But he would not listen, and I was told to take my services elsewhere.
; str_npc15_backstory_b|One of the merchants wanted a new tower added his house. Trouble is, he ran out of cash halfway through the process, before I could complete the supports. I told him that it would collapse, and it did. Unfortunately he was standing on it, at the time. His son didn't feel like honouring his fathers debts and implied that I might find myself charged with murder if I push the point.
; str_npc16_backstory_b|I grew up in Whitewalls, a ward of the castellan, working alongside the other boys as a squire. On my sevententh nameday, at a tourney no less, I received my knighthood at the hands of lord Mallister himself. That was also the day that I first saw lady Alera, and I am fairly sure that she also saw me. At least I suppose she did, for that night, I found her naked as the day she was born, in my bed.
; str_npc17_backstory_b|But never mind that, I'm sure you will hear it all across the world once I'm done! I'm quite sure you've heard of me, but in case my fame does not preceed me, allow me to tell you the story of my life. I was born the first and only son of the High Priest of Lys, Horonno Lynaqo, but the courts of the free cities never interested me, with their power play and cruel gossip. So when my father died, I decided to become a wandering minstrel, rather than following in his foot steps.
; str_npc18_backstory_b|My arrow was caught by the wind, I had no intention of shooting my brothers wife in the neck! But they won't listen, and it won't be the Wall for me, I'll be hanged and quartered!
; str_npc19_backstory_b|I am Saathos, of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or ever will be. Saathos the Wise after gazing upon Qarth for the first time, because he knew that all he saw thereafter should look squalid and ugly by comparison, tore out his eyes. Why my noble father named me after a madman, I shall never know. Ah, but I digress. Saathos of Qarth I am, a great traveller, explorer and scholar.
; str_npc20_backstory_b|I've served as a palace guard for the Archon of Tyrosh, and lately I have fought in the Disputed Lands, as a member of the Brave Companions.
; str_npc21_backstory_b|When he returned to our ancestral castle, he burned the local septon as an offering to a vile new god, and tortured anyone who refused to convert to his new faith. As a result, my family was outlawed, and we have been wandering the world ever since.
; str_npc22_backstory_b|The aristocracy ain't nothing but common thieves and bandits, that's what they are. How foolish I was putting my trust in them with the hope that they would protect me and my family from any foe. No, I learned the hard way, they are the ones to be feared. And to think we are highborn! Of greater birth than any of those beasts! They where supposed to protect us on our travel through the Vale! Our family lost most its lands after the War of the Usurper, and we've been living little better than peasants since. Until my father got an offer from a rich merchant in Gulltown, offering that his son and my sister be married. Such a match could restore our fortune!
; str_npc23_backstory_b|My sister Ferro is fighting with some sellsword company, and I've heard she's become a valued advisor to the captain. And maybe she warms his bed, should he get lonely! A bastard is loathed and pitied all over the world, but still! About time Ferro had herself a few babes anyhow, I find it best to start young. Got two babes myself, a daughter and a son.
; str_npc24_backstory_b|And what happens to the people that stayed loyal to the Targaryens? Well, we're out of a job, with our lives taken over by thieves and murderers. Bah!
; str_npc25_backstory_b|CARVING IT, CARVING IT, CARVING IT. Unseeing, unthinking, moving through the city as aimlessly as a worm burrows through the earth. CARVE, CARVE, CARVE!
; str_npc26_backstory_b|My tale is my own.
; str_npc27_backstory_b|I'm a member of house Waterman, we're from the North. My brother is sworn to lord Bolton, but daughters ah... they're not supposed to run around in mail and fighting with swords. White Harbor is where most highborn ladies end up, if they don't marry. Special sort of woman who doesn't marry, and they're quite content in White Harbor. All those septas, eh?
; str_npc28_backstory_b|All her tall tales, and for what? Nothing! My father, my sister, my brother, all gone. And now she sends another one to persuade me. Well, you can tell Tamora that she can go fuck herself. I don't care what it is this time. Gold, silver, the bejewelled member of the Father Above, I say no, no, no!
; str_npc1_backstory_c|I was young and out of my wits, and foolishly swore to never enter the lists of another tourney, as a penance. So I was forced to serve as a sworn knight and merchants guard, and that does not offer opportunity for glory, nor wealth.
; str_npc2_backstory_c|I've been trying to get home, but the roads are filled with outlaws, and so, here I am, no money, no ship, no crew, a piece of paper and no way to go.
; str_npc3_backstory_c|I can tend to your horse, keep the rust off your armor and cook your dinner. And I have a thunderous voice, to announce your entrance in tourneys!
; str_npc4_backstory_c|I have no intentions of returning to Slaver's Bay anytime soon, and my coin has not lasted as long as I'd hoped it would. Perhaps I will one day start training soldiers in this part of the world. My father was one of the Good Masters, and his father before him. I can turn soldiers into Unsullied! Or as close as possible, without cutting off their cock and balls, hah!
; str_npc5_backstory_c|Things continued much as they had once lady Lysa returned, though I confess I would have liked to beat that son of hers. A weak coward if I ever saw one, which is not what lord Jon deserved. Anyway, recently a singer joined the household, a petty and sallow creature called Marillion. Sadly, however, the lady Lysa is very fond of him. When he tried to rape my maiden daughter, I beat him bloody with my own fists. And for that lady Lysa banished me! Not the singer, me! I had no choice but to send my family to live with my lord father in the Reach, and hit the road in search of work.
; str_npc6_backstory_c|I am an able fighter, though nothing out of the extraordinary, but I do find myself better than most men with a bow and arrow. I am also a seasoned scout, having ridden with the outriders of the Stormcrows for some time.
; str_npc7_backstory_c|I have served as a sworn sword to lord Royce Coldwater, of Coldwater, and lord Damon Marbrand, the Lord of Ashemark. I served under his son Ser Addam Marbrand in the field, though we did not see much action. I have distinguised myself in tourneys, but since the outbreak of war, my loyalties have been called into question, my father being a trueborn son of lord Walder, and I was honorably discharged. So, as you can see, I am no mere hedge knight.
; str_npc8_backstory_c|...
; str_npc9_backstory_c|But my father did not care, and had me banished from his household. I imagine he'd thought I'd leave meekly, hah! I killed my father that day, thrusting my dagger through his windpipe! Then I fleed. The Westerosi claims that no one is as cursed as the kinslayer. I'm inclined to agree. My stepmother has sent men to bring me back to a grizzly fate.
; str_npc10_backstory_c|Perhaps we should play a game of cyvasse one day.
; str_npc11_backstory_c|Truth be told, I don't think my winnings will last that much longer, whores are expensive!
; str_npc12_backstory_c|The reverence for former maesters, accused of sorcery, is, I fear, not all it could be. Oh, how the light of wisdom is often darkened by the ignorance and stupidity of man!
; str_npc13_backstory_c|I am no Kingslayer, nor Knight of Flowers, but I do find myself somewhat adequate with a lance and sword.
; str_npc14_backstory_c|I know, I know, I am dothraki, I ought to be out there on the plains, slaying men with one hand and plundering with the other. But that life is not for me. I do enjoy battle, but I also enjoy the pleasures of civilization.
; str_npc15_backstory_c|More fool me for having taken the contract without an advance though, I suppose.
; str_npc16_backstory_c|The next day, the servants told her lord father. I suppose I should have known that nothing is secret in a castle. I was promptly expelled, under threat of death if I was ever to return. A harsh punishment, considering the girl was in my bed, willing!
; str_npc17_backstory_c|And I am having the time of my life! Living under hedges, singing to the small and inconsequental folk, never wanting for anything.
; str_npc18_backstory_c|I've been running from them for what feels like years!
; str_npc19_backstory_c|I travel the world collecting rare specimens of everything, that I might increase the splendor of the Queen of Cities with my discoveries.
; str_npc20_backstory_c|I'm a master of the spear and short sword, and in the Brave Companions I served as a regimental officer, until that madman, Vargo Hoat, took over. There's an unpleasant and vile man if ever I say one.
; str_npc21_backstory_c|To attone for my ancestors sinful life, I've joined the Faith and have been ordained a septon. The father guides me, and the Mother shows me mercy. The Warrior gives me strength, and the Maiden aids me in keeping my vows. The Smith guides me in my labor, and the Crone grants me wisdom.
; str_npc22_backstory_c|We hired hedge knights to protect us from the mountain tribes on our way from the Bloody Gate through the mountains, and all seemed well. But one night our protectors got drunk and they raped my sister! My father charged at them with sword in hand, but he was old and was quickly cut down. The false knights fled soon after, leaving me with a defiled sister. Obviously, her worth as a marriage subject was ruined after her rape, and I've been forced to travel as a sellsword to support her.
; str_npc23_backstory_c|Ahh, I need to get out and fight myself! Been itching to hit something other than a man.
; str_npc24_backstory_c|It was no way for brave Roddy to live, being an outcast, forced to live like a common sellsword! I'm glad you came along!
; str_npc25_backstory_c|Who are you, who are these people? Why are my hands always red?!
; str_npc26_backstory_c|...
; str_npc27_backstory_c|Used to be house Waterman held sway over much of the Lonely Hills, but that glorious past is, well, in the past.
; str_npc28_backstory_c|Ever been attacked by a Hrakkar, {playername}? That's how I got this scar! And that's the second smallest scar I have! The smallest scar is the result of a manticore attack! Scars and dead relatives, that's what all my hard work and trekking across the world has gotten me, while she grows richer every day!
; str_npc1_backstory_later|I've been here and about, you know. I'm desperately in need of work, however.
; str_npc2_backstory_later|I sold my boots and have managed to make a few coins peddling goods from town to town, but it's a hard living.
; str_npc3_backstory_later|I've been helping out various town watches as of late. It seems like the whole world is at war.
; str_npc4_backstory_later|So it was not one dragon, but three, who burned Astapor. And they are commanded by the beggar kings sister, Daenerys Targaryen. I find that three dragons are ever more fearsome than just one, so I think I'll be staying in the west. The women here have nicer tits anyway.
; str_npc5_backstory_later|Hello there, friend. I'm still looking for work. One would think that it was easy to come by with all these wars.
; str_npc6_backstory_later|I have been wandering the free cities for some time, though I am yet to find employment.
; str_npc7_backstory_later|Ah, hello my friend, how fare you? I myself have had no luck finding a new lord. You would think that knights would be able to find employment with all the fighting going on, but it seems not. And I am a son of Ser Stevron Frey! No mere beggar knight, a lord should be glad to have my sword!
; str_npc8_backstory_later|My lord! I once again offer you my services! Truth be told, I'm in quite some trouble, nothing you need to concern yourself with.
; str_npc9_backstory_later|I've offered my services to a few lords in these parts. But I find as often as not they'll ask me to run messages, or train peasants, or some other job not fit for a nobleman born in Pentos, mightiest of the free cities!.
; str_npc10_backstory_later|Hello there! I suppose you've yet to learn the rules of cyvasse. A shame.
; str_npc11_backstory_later|Welcome, friend! Mayhaps you need the champion archer of Oldtown in your party! Truth be told, I've been having a bit of bad luck at the dice table, and I fear that some of my less genial gambling partners might soon be coming for me.
; str_npc12_backstory_later|I have been here and about, tending to the sick and taking what reward I can. But the people of these parts are ignorant, and have little respect for my craft. They place more faith in their illiterate septon than in me! The few coins I make are barely enough for me to replenish my stock of remedies. I should be grateful for the chance to find other work.
; str_npc13_backstory_later|Should you choose to take me on as your sworn man, I assure you that I will perform most admirably. Otherwise, I will have to continue searching for a worthy lord.
; str_npc14_backstory_later|I have gone from court to court, but I have not yet found a lord who is to my liking. And they all consider me a savage! Bah!, I have long ago laid the life of the Dothraki behind me.
; str_npc15_backstory_later|I've been going from castle to castle, looking to see if walls or towers need repair. But either the lord's away, or he's got other things on his mind, or I run into his creditors on the street, begging for change, and I realize that here's one job not to take. So if you hear of anything, let me know.
; str_npc16_backstory_later|I fight the odd tourney, now and then, but I would willingly swear an oath of allegiance to you my lord.
; str_npc17_backstory_later|Hello my friend! Have you by chance heard any of my songs being praised by the lords you've visited? If not, might be I could join you for a while.
; str_npc18_backstory_later|I seem to have lost my pursuers, but you never know. I rue the day that pox faced bitch decided she wanted to frolic around the woods with the men.
; str_npc19_backstory_later|Ah, {playername}. I cry to see your face, as my quest for specimens has not yielded even the slightest thing of interest.
; str_npc20_backstory_later|I've heard rumours of dragons and war in the east, might be I'll try my luck in Slaver's Bay. Unless you need my expertise that is, my lord.
; str_npc21_backstory_later|The Stranger have a hold of the world, as of late war and death has been sweeping the lands.
; str_npc22_backstory_later|My sister has recently given birth to a bastard boy, the end result of her unfortunate... accident... in the Vale. The gods truly hate us.
; str_npc23_backstory_later|Ah, {playername}. Welcome back. Have you changed your mind about me joining you on your journey?
; str_npc24_backstory_later|Ah, {playername}. Have you changed your mind about guards?
; str_npc25_backstory_later|{playername}! Get me out of here! CARVE ME OUT OF HERE!
; str_npc26_backstory_later|{playername}. Still lurking around here?
; str_npc27_backstory_later|{playername}. Still here?
str_npc28_backstory_later|Cože, {playername}?
; str_npc1_backstory_response_1|You seem a stout enough fellow Ser Bennis, perharps you would like to join my company?
; str_npc2_backstory_response_1|Well, perhaps I could offer you work. Can you fight?
; str_npc3_backstory_response_1|Well, as it happens, I do believe you could be of use to me.
; str_npc4_backstory_response_1|Hmm, I have never heard of the Unsullied before, but perhaps you can enlighten me. I welcome you into my service.
; str_npc5_backstory_response_1|I could well use a knight in my retinue.
; str_npc6_backstory_response_1|Well, you seem like an able enough man, mayhaps you'd like to join my company?
; str_npc7_backstory_response_1|Hmm... I am sure you would not enjoy my mens company, bastard born as they are, but I ask you to consider joining me.
; str_npc8_backstory_response_1|I could use the services of a maester, but tell me why I should hire you and not an actual maester, fresh out the Citadel?
; str_npc9_backstory_response_1|Perhaps you would like to join my company for a while?
; str_npc10_backstory_response_1|If you're looking for work, I could certainly use an able officer.
; str_npc11_backstory_response_1|Well, might indeed be I could use a champion archer.
; str_npc12_backstory_response_1|Well, you could travel with us, but you'd have to be able to fight in our battle line.
; str_npc13_backstory_response_1|I might be able to use an extra sword in my company.
; str_npc14_backstory_response_1|I might be able to use you in my company.
; str_npc15_backstory_response_1|Where do you need to go?
; str_npc16_backstory_response_1|Perhaps you would travel with me for a while, Ser.
; str_npc17_backstory_response_1|How wonderful for you. Say, would you like to travel with me for a while?.
; str_npc18_backstory_response_1|That's terrible! If there is anything I could do to help...
; str_npc19_backstory_response_1|You seem lost, might as well join me.
; str_npc20_backstory_response_1|I could always use a good soldier.
; str_npc21_backstory_response_1|Travel with me, I have friends who are in need of saving.
; str_npc22_backstory_response_1|Join me, and might be you can reverse your fortunes.
; str_npc23_backstory_response_1|Not at all, my lady.
; str_npc24_backstory_response_1|I have great need for a guardsman in my retinue!
; str_npc25_backstory_response_1|Can you hold a sword?
; str_npc26_backstory_response_1|What would it take to persuade you to serve me?
; str_npc27_backstory_response_1|Would you like to join me?
; str_npc28_backstory_response_1|I have no clue who this Tamora is. I'm looking for men to join my retinue.
; str_npc1_backstory_response_2|I am afraid I cannot currently take on any more men. Blessings of the Warrior to you, Ser Bennis.
; str_npc2_backstory_response_2|Hard luck, friend. Good day to you.
; str_npc3_backstory_response_2|I am sorry lad, but no.
; str_npc4_backstory_response_2|No, sorry, I haven't heard of one.
; str_npc5_backstory_response_2|I'm afraid I cannot hire you, Ser Felton.
; str_npc6_backstory_response_2|I have no need of sellswords.
; str_npc7_backstory_response_2|Yes, yes, very interesting. I fear I must be on my way, good day to you Ser Jasper.
; str_npc8_backstory_response_2|I'm not going to shelter a deserter, or whatever you are. Farewell.
; str_npc9_backstory_response_2|I demand that all my men do whatever I ask them. Good day to you, nobleman.
; str_npc10_backstory_response_2|I'm sorry, but I fear another officer in our midst would not benefit my retinue.
; str_npc11_backstory_response_2|Very interesting, but I have work to do.
; str_npc12_backstory_response_2|Sorry. I can't take on any new hands.
; str_npc13_backstory_response_2|No, sorry. I'm afraid I do not need any more swords by my side.
; str_npc14_backstory_response_2|I'll let you know if I hear of anything. Good day.
; str_npc15_backstory_response_2|Sorry. I've got all the men that I can manage right now.
; str_npc16_backstory_response_2|Sorry. You sound like you might be trouble.
; str_npc17_backstory_response_2|I'm sorry, but I don't know anyone with a pouch large enough to fill your ambitions.
; str_npc18_backstory_response_2|Wait, you ran away after killing the wife of your brother?
; str_npc19_backstory_response_2|You confuse me.
; str_npc20_backstory_response_2|I'm afraid I have no need of any more men at this point.
; str_npc21_backstory_response_2|I must beg my leave.
; str_npc22_backstory_response_2|Good day to you, my lord.
; str_npc23_backstory_response_2|I'm afraid I could not bring a woman into danger, my lady.
; str_npc24_backstory_response_2|Not right now.
; str_npc25_backstory_response_2|Nevermind.
; str_npc26_backstory_response_2|Right...
; str_npc27_backstory_response_2|I must beg my leave.
; str_npc28_backstory_response_2|Right...
; str_npc1_signup|Gladly! Perhaps I'll finally get out of this horrid business of protecting upstart merchants and their fat wives!
; str_npc2_signup|Well, I must confess that I am not a warrior by trade.
; str_npc3_signup|You do? I am much obliged to you Ser!
; str_npc4_signup|Very well! I shall teach you all about the Unsullied, the best soldiers in the world, the legacy of the lockstep legions of Ghis!
; str_npc5_signup|Well that certainly is most welcome news.
; str_npc6_signup|I'd be more than willing.
; str_npc7_signup|I might join you. I need to be assured that you will not force me to chatter with the low born men of your company, I am, after all, a knight, and the son of a Frey.
; str_npc8_signup|I doubt any maester would join a party of warriors. I don't have the same scrubbles. Furthermore, know that I would be ever indebted to you, ever grateful, ever loyal.
; str_npc9_signup|That would be most splendid my friend! You do not seem the sort to send me to do tasks not befit my rank.
; str_npc10_signup|How splendid! I assure you that no soldier will cause you trouble, not while I command them. If they do, they'll hang for it.
; str_npc11_signup|Great! Perhaps I'll one day command soldiers of my own!
; str_npc12_signup|As I told you, I am a surgeon, not some silk-robed Archmaester who has never touched a body. I can get my hands dirty. Look at them, they're dirty this very moment!
; str_npc13_signup|Indeed? You would do well to enlist me, while a fifth son, I am nonetheless a knight of Standfast, and sure to perform most honorably.
; str_npc14_signup|I would be pleased to ride with you, at least for a little while, for pay and a share of any loot.
; str_npc15_signup|Qohor, eventually, but I'd welcome the opportunity to get a few coins in my pocket, first, so I don't arrive at the city empty handed. So if you promise me food and a share of the loot, I'd be happy to fight with you for a while.
; str_npc16_signup|I would certainly do that!
; str_npc17_signup|That would be wonderful, I've been looking for inspiration for a new grand epic poem, and I might gain some from your exploits!.
; str_npc18_signup|Really? Do you really want to help me? Thank the Drowned God that I met you, and may He watch over you.
; str_npc19_signup|Ah, that would be most splendid. I cry to think of the adventures we shall experience together, {playername}.
; str_npc20_signup|Splendid. I assure you, your enemies will tremble when I travel with you!
; str_npc21_signup|Very well, the world need to be brought back into the light of the Seven, I'll travel with you and spread the Faith.
; str_npc22_signup|How magnificent! A chance to restore the honor of House Cargyll!
; str_npc23_signup|How great! I'll have to go grab my belongings, and then I'll be ready to go!
; str_npc24_signup|Great! I'll go grab my sword!
; str_npc25_signup|I'll hold whatever you want me to, as long as you get me out of here! GIVE ME A CLEAVER, TO CARVE, CARVE, CARVE!
; str_npc26_signup|Double what I've ever been paid.
; str_npc27_signup|I would, I would! I'm so very tired of hanging around in taverns.
; str_npc28_signup|Oh... my apologies then. You're the first one in a while who didn't turn out to be one of her slaves in disguise. The woman is mad, I'll tell you that. But you say you're looking for men?
; str_npc1_signup_2|I have travelled the world for near forty years, first as a squire and later as an annointed knight, and I doubt any man have had more experience protecting merchants than I.
; str_npc2_signup_2|But I'm a fast learner. I can ride, and I know a fair bit about trade, prices and such.
; str_npc3_signup_2|I think you'll find that I'll be a most valuable addition to your ranks.
; str_npc4_signup_2|Remember, however, that I am of the ancient and honorable House of Paton, and I expect to be treated as such. I don't want to be seen as equal to those filthy soldiers one often finds in these lands.
; str_npc5_signup_2|I shall not betray you, {my lord/my lady}. I shall, however, say the words of fealty somewhere other than this stinking tavern, if you don't mind.
; str_npc6_signup_2|Know, however, that I do not intend to follow you into battle if there is no hope of victory. I intend to live a long life. I do not require payment right away, only that you armor and feed me.
; str_npc7_signup_2|I imagine that the brutes and thieves of your company will even find that my presence might better their behavior, and I am sure that your men will fight with ever more valor being in the presence of an anointed knight.
; str_npc8_signup_2|I shall serve you untill I die, or, the Gods forbid, you pass beneath the shadow yourself.
; str_npc9_signup_2|My teacher in Pentos was Lytharo, the Third Sword, so I know well how to handle a sword. Or a dagger, hah! I ask only of you, that you will one day help me reclaim what is rightfully mine, or mayhaps help me attain something to cover my loses.
; str_npc10_signup_2|Let's celebrate by playing a round of cyvasse, shall we? And perhaps we can order some fine wine!
; str_npc11_signup_2|I'll meet you outside the tavern whenever you're ready to continue, {my lord/my lady}.
; str_npc12_signup_2|Should you ever be in need of a keeper of ravens, {my lord/my lady}, rest assured that I would have no trouble filling such a position. Just as I could teach any son you might have the history of the world, the conquests of Aegon, the fall of Valyria, the Blackfyre rebellion, even the War of the Vulture King, my repetoire is endless. I might well be able to act as your confident in matters of economics and trade as well, my training was almost complete when I was expelled from the Citadel.
; str_npc13_signup_2|Perhaps I'll even one day hold my own castle, following you, {my lord/my lady}! You seem one for great deeds.
; str_npc14_signup_2|I am a skilled swordsman and archer, and I can also instruct your men in fighting. But I warn you that I do not care to fight for a leader who is lax in discipline with {his/her} men, for in the long run they will not respect a soft hand. Nor will they live very long.
; str_npc15_signup_2|Siegework is my speciality, although I reckon can handle myself well enough in an open battle, if need be.
; str_npc16_signup_2|I am a knight, and as such I am better than most with lance and sword.
; str_npc17_signup_2|Perhaps we will one day sing of this day!
; str_npc18_signup_2|If I can stay with you, no-one would dare harm me. I'll do my best to be of help around you.
; str_npc19_signup_2|I can perform even the most advanced surgery, and my worldly knowledge is without match. Together, we shall make discoveries such as none have made before!
; str_npc20_signup_2|My sturdy spear shall bring us many great victories.
; str_npc21_signup_2|May the Warrior grant your arm strenght!
; str_npc22_signup_2|By the Seven, finally my fortune takes a turn for the better.
; str_npc23_signup_2|By the Gods, I've been itching to swing my axe around some!
; str_npc24_signup_2|By the Warrior! I'll never have to talk to a merchant again!
; str_npc25_signup_2|Help me get home, please {playername}!
; str_npc26_signup_2|I won't do everything you should ask of me, but any man try to kill you, he ends up dead himself.
; str_npc27_signup_2|Taverns really do get rather dreary after a while, I'll tell you that {playername}.
; str_npc28_signup_2|As you can plainly see, I'm as manly as can be. Titus Harper is my name, the rightful Lord of Blackstone. Proud name, long and and storied. My castle is in the Reach, but after Robert's Rebellion we where... forced from it. Fate has left me here with no means to survive but my skill with the bow. I'll gladly join your retinue.
; str_npc1_signup_response_1|Good. You can be useful to us.
; str_npc2_signup_response_1|That will do.
; str_npc3_signup_response_1|Good. Now come along.
; str_npc4_signup_response_1|Very well. I'll be glad to have you with us, um, my, erh lord ...
; str_npc5_signup_response_1|Certainly.
; str_npc6_signup_response_1|That seems fair enough. Get your things together, we'll leave soon.
; str_npc7_signup_response_1|I welcome you to our company then, Ser Jasper Rivers, son of Ser Stevron Frey, son of lord Walder Frey, the Lord of the Crossing.
; str_npc8_signup_response_1|Hmm, time will tell whether this was wise. Welcome to my retinue.
; str_npc9_signup_response_1|I suppose I can help you out, sometime in the future. For now, I'll need you to follow my orders, and not stab me in the throat.
; str_npc10_signup_response_1|You'll have to teach me how, then. I fear we'll have to postpone the fine vine for another occasion.
; str_npc11_signup_response_1|Very good, I'll make sure to inform you when we're ready to continue.
; str_npc12_signup_response_1|Then welcome to our company, erh, maester Brynden.
; str_npc13_signup_response_1|Good. Make yourself ready, and we'll be on our way. 
; str_npc14_signup_response_1|Good. I'll be happy to hire someone like you.
; str_npc15_signup_response_1|That works for me. I will be pleased to hire you.
; str_npc16_signup_response_1|It sounds like you'd be a valuable asset in a battle, welcome to my company.
; str_npc17_signup_response_1|You can write about all of my famous battles and conquests!
; str_npc18_signup_response_1|Pack your stuff, boy, it is time you left these lands.
; str_npc19_signup_response_1|Very good.
; str_npc20_signup_response_1|Yes, they will, obviously...
; str_npc21_signup_response_1|Well then, let's be on our way.
; str_npc22_signup_response_1|That's the spirit!
; str_npc23_signup_response_1|Right!
; str_npc24_signup_response_1|Right!
; str_npc25_signup_response_1|Erh, yeah, let me think about it...
; str_npc26_signup_response_1|Seems a fair request.
; str_npc27_signup_response_1|Erh, right.
; str_npc28_signup_response_1|That's the spirit!
; str_npc1_signup_response_2|I'd prefer not having to embarras you, Ser Bennis.
; str_npc2_signup_response_2|I'm afraid I'm only looking for men with some experience. Good day to you.
; str_npc3_signup_response_2|I'm sorry, I have no need of you.
; str_npc4_signup_response_2|I'm not interested in your services.
; str_npc5_signup_response_2|Actually, on second thought, I find that I have no use for you.
; str_npc6_signup_response_2|On second thought, maybe a sellswords company is not what I need right now.
; str_npc7_signup_response_2|Actually, on second thought, you sound like you might be trouble. Good day to you, Ser. 
; str_npc8_signup_response_2|This does not seem like a good idea, I have to decline your, hmm, offer.
; str_npc9_signup_response_2|Bah!, kinslayer, I'll have none of your sort in my company.
; str_npc10_signup_response_2|On second thought, I doubt you'd be of much use.
; str_npc11_signup_response_2|Sorry. We've already got as many in our company as we can handle.
; str_npc12_signup_response_2|Perhaps you should look elsewhere for work.
; str_npc13_signup_response_2|Actually, on second thought, a knight overeager for glory is dangerous to have in one's company.
; str_npc14_signup_response_2|Actually, I have no wish to provoke a mutiny in my ranks. Good day, son of Khal Ogo.
; str_npc15_signup_response_2|Actually, I need a different kind of expertise. My apologies.
; str_npc16_signup_response_2|To be honest, I'd prefer someone who was a little less tempted to seduce highborn maidens.
; str_npc17_signup_response_2|What are you rambling about? I need a decent fighter, not a pretty singer.
; str_npc18_signup_response_2|I'm sorry, I meant to help you here, not to drag you around the world. I can't do that.
; str_npc19_signup_response_2|I'm afraid I have no need for a scholar.
; str_npc20_signup_response_2|I'm afraid I still do not need your services.
; str_npc21_signup_response_2|...
; str_npc22_signup_response_2|I'm afraid that it is not possible at this time.
; str_npc23_signup_response_2|I'm afraid that I've changed my mind, you cannot travel with me.
; str_npc24_signup_response_2|I'm afraid that I've changed my mind, I do not need a guardsman.
; str_npc25_signup_response_2|I may not need you right this moment...
; str_npc26_signup_response_2|I've changed my mind.
; str_npc27_signup_response_2|I'm afraid I've changed my mind.
; str_npc28_signup_response_2|I'm afraid I've changed my mind.
; str_npc1_payment|Quite good. Before we leave however, there is the small matter of my payment. I believe {reg3} silver coins would be a fair amount.
; str_npc4_payment|Quite excellent. Before we depart, would you be so kind to lend me {reg3} silver coins? I had to pawn a family heirloom at a pawnbroker here in {s20}, and I would like to retrieve it before we leave.
; str_npc5_payment|Thank you. Now, to seal off our agreement, I ask for {reg3} silver coins from you. Knights might be true to their lord, no matter what, but they'll be ever more true if they can afford to feed themselves.
; str_npc7_payment|Quite good then. I shall ask you to pay me a small token pay of {reg3} silver coins, just a knightly formality, a silly old tradition, hardly even worth mentioning.
; str_npc8_payment|Wonderful {my lord/my lady}! Might I ask you for a small fee? You will not find me of much use without remedies and poultices, and I fear those are costly. I shall not need more than {reg3} silver coins.
; str_npc9_payment|That's very good of you. And before I join, can you lend me {reg3} silver coins, so that I can buy some proper clothing that befits a man of noble birth such as myself. The coat on me has been worn down badly due to my recent bad fortune, and I cannot let common soldiers mistake me as one of their own.
; str_npc10_payment|I'll teach you! It's really quite simple. There is one little problem though, my liege. I have a woman here in {s20}, a tavern wench, and she says she bears my child in her belly. I want to give her some coin before I leave... for the child, you know. Being a bastard is not easy. Do you think you can spare {reg3} silver coins?
; str_npc11_payment|Before we continue, {my lord/my lady}, might I ask for my payment in advance? {reg3} silver coins should suffice to keep my poor father feed until I return. I sure hope it'll be a long autumn.
; str_npc13_payment|Very good {my lord/my lady}. Before we leave, however, there is the small matter of the customary payment. Just a formality, though one that I would have a hard time doing without. I suppose {reg3} silver coins would be fair?
; str_npc14_payment|Ah, one last thing. I would ask for an initial bounty of {reg3} silver coins before I join your command. It's my principle never to enter someone's service without receiving the payment I deserve.
; str_npc15_payment|Good. By the way, as a skilled engineer I would expect a payment for my services. A signing bonus of {reg3} silver coins would be fair, I think. I'll deposit it with the representatives of the Iron Bank here in {s20} before we leave, that seems the most prudent strategy. One never knows what might happen on the road.
; str_npc16_payment|Good {my lord/my lady}. Before we leave, might I trouble you for a small loan? I've left a girl in this very tavern with a somewhat, erm, heavy burden in her belly, and I fear her father might be less inclined to bash my head in, if his hands are filled with coin.
; str_npc17_payment|Very well my friend! Now before we continue, might be you could loan me some coin, I have some less than amiable fellows whom I owe a small amount for some fine Arbor wine.
; str_npc20_payment|I pledge my sword to you, {my lord/my lady}. Before we leave, I ask that you pay me the customary {reg3} silver coins for my service.
; str_npc21_payment|Before I can travel with you, you'll need to grant a small gift to the Faith, {reg3} silver coins should we sufficient. I'll make sure it's sent to the Great Sept in King's Landing.
; str_npc22_payment|There is only one problem... I needs be must sew a new banner to fly high the sigil of House Cargyll. I imagine {reg3} silver coins would suffice.
; str_npc24_payment|Say, I think my armor needs a proper taking care of. The blacksmith here in this town can do it for me, but it'll cost about {reg3} coins. Any chance you'd be willing to loan me the coin?
; str_npc26_payment|{reg3} coins it is, then. And a share of any plunder, plus wine.
; str_npc27_payment|Now, while taverns lose their luster after a while, whores never do, and I owe quite a large sum to the one with the big... ears over there. Could you spare {reg3} coins for me to pay him? I've heard he once hacked of a mans thumb for not paying him, and I rather like mine. Now, I know what you're thinking, {reg3} coins for one whore? But it's just not him, its the wine, the roast swans, the peppered caviar, the other whore, the barrel filled with ale I broke. You get the picture, surely?
; str_npc28_payment|Quite good. Before we leave however, there is the small matter of my payment. I believe {reg3} silver coins would be a fair amount.
; str_npc1_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} coins. Now, pack your backs, we'll be leaving soon.
; str_npc4_payment_response|Certainly. Here's {reg3} coins.
; str_npc5_payment_response|Hah, very true. Here is {reg3} coins.
; str_npc7_payment_response|Yes, yes, of course, just a formality, a silly old tradition.
; str_npc8_payment_response|Oh, I am no pauper, Halbert. Here's {reg3} coins for you.
; str_npc9_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} coins.
; str_npc10_payment_response|Of course. Here, {reg3} coins.
; str_npc11_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} coins. Make yourself ready. We leave soon.
; str_npc13_payment_response|Of course, here's {reg3} coins. Get ready to leave soon.
; str_npc14_payment_response|All right, here's {reg3} coins. You are most welcome in our company.
; str_npc15_payment_response|All right, here's {reg3} coins. Glad to have you with us.
; str_npc16_payment_response|I'm sure he'll be ever grateful to you. Here is {reg3} coins, be ready to leave soon.
; str_npc17_payment_response|{reg3} coins? You dare! I like that, I'll be happy to oblige you.
; str_npc19_payment_response|All right, here's a few coins.
; str_npc20_payment_response|That seems more than fair. Here are the {reg3} coins.
; str_npc21_payment_response|Very well.
; str_npc22_payment_response|Of course. Here are {reg3} coins. Hurry, I'll be leaving soon.
; str_npc24_payment_response|Here are {reg3} coins. Make him hurry, I'll be leaving soon.
; str_npc26_payment_response|Here are {reg3} coins. You better be worth it.
; str_npc27_payment_response|Here are {reg3} coins. Go pay the whore.
; str_npc28_payment_response|Here are {reg3} coins. You better be worth it.
; str_npc1_morality_speech|{My lord/My lady}. Please don't take this the wrong way, but it's a hard life and it's a bit much that we {s21}. Take a little more care in the future, if you don't mind my saying.
; str_npc2_morality_speech|I hope you don't mind my saying so, but it's a bit hard for me to see us {s21}. Maybe I ought to try to be more of a hardened soldier, but if we could try to exercise a little mercy from time to time, I'd sleep better.
; str_npc3_morality_speech|Perhaps it is not my place to say so, {my lord/my lady}, but I confess that I am somewhat shocked that we {s21}. Of course I realize that war is cruel, but there is no need to make it more cruel than necessary.
; str_npc4_morality_speech|Your pardon -- just so you know, the men of the House of Paton do not care to {s21}. I will not be pleased if you continue to take this course, it's beneath me!
; str_npc5_morality_speech|Pardon me, {my lord/my lady}. It is not good to {s21}. Your first duty is to the men who have decided to follow you. The least they can expect is food, pay, the opportunity to loot, and that you not waste their lives needlessly.
; str_npc6_morality_speech|Excuse me, {my lord/my lady}. I did not expect to {s21}.
; str_npc7_morality_speech|My liege -- I do not like to see us {s21}. Such are the actions of a common outlaw, with no regard for his honor.
; str_npc8_morality_speech|I was not pleased that you decided to {s21}. To fall in battle is an honour, but to fight in a warband led by a coward is a disgrace.
; str_npc9_morality_speech|Your grace -- it is not my way to {s21}. Men of my house will accept death but not dishonour. Please do not make me ashamed to serve under you.
; str_npc10_morality_speech|Begging your pardon, I can't say that I'm happy to see us {s21}. Those are just simple people, trying to make a living. If we could try to go easy on the poor wretches, my liege, I'd feel much better.
; str_npc11_morality_speech|Excuse me, {playername}. It's not good that we {s21}. I've followed an army once, and the least the soldiers expect of a leader is to feed them, pay them, and do {his/her} best to keep their sorry skins intact as best {he/she} can.
; str_npc12_morality_speech|{My lord/My lady} -- I do not like to see us {s21}. I am prepared to be a warrior, but not an outlaw. Pray let us try to show a little more compassion.
; str_npc13_morality_speech|Your grace, if we can avoid it, I'd prefer not to {s21}. Word gets around, and one's reputation is precious. I would not care for one of my rivals to have a singer include this latest unfortunate incident in a satirical verse.
; str_npc14_morality_speech|I do not care to {s21}. No one with a reputation for cowardice will be properly feared by his men.
; str_npc15_morality_speech|Just so you know my opinion, any commander with sense will not let his company {s21}.I hope you don't mind me speaking so bluntly.
; str_npc16_morality_speech|I don't like to {s21}. So many throats left uncut, and so many maidens left untouched.
; str_npc17_morality_speech|What kind of commander are you? Look at the men, and all the bodies on the field. Remember these {s21}, for they will haunt you in the end.
; str_npc18_morality_speech|Why did you {s21}? When I thought you'd protect me, I didn't expect you to act as my village elder would!
; str_npc19_morality_speech|....
; str_npc20_morality_speech|Why, why did you {s21}? Is it because they were heathens?  In which case conversion would be better or are you evil in disguise?
; str_npc21_morality_speech|I might have fallen from grace, but that doesn't make me dishonerable. Don't disgrace yourself by {s21}, my friend.
; str_npc22_morality_speech|Are you out of your mind? I thought I could trust you, but by {s21} you only showed that you're one of them nobles. Don't you dare let that happen again!
; str_npc23_morality_speech|My friend. It's a hard life for most of the folks in these lands, and it's a bit much that we {s21}. Take a little more care in the future.
; str_npc24_morality_speech|Are you out of your mind? I thought you where a honorable man, but by {s21} you only showed that you're no better than any other lord. Don't you dare let that happen again!
; str_npc1_2ary_morality_speech|My liege -- just so you know, I've got no problem if we {s21}. Living to fight another day makes good sense to me.
; str_npc2_2ary_morality_speech|I'm not altogether happy that we {s21}. I'm a merchant, and in our business one is bonded by one's word. I don't want a reputation for dishonesty -- that would spell my end as a trader, {playername}!.
; str_npc3_2ary_morality_speech|I think it was a brave decision you took to {s21}. There is no shame in finding a way to avoid the spilling of blood. The less blood you spill, the more tourneys you can fight in.
; str_npc4_2ary_morality_speech|Your pardon -- whatever anyone else says, I think nothing of it that you {s21}. You should adopt whatever ruse you need to survive in these filthy, savage, lands.
; str_npc9_2ary_morality_speech|I am dismayed that you {s21}. A noble such as yourself should exhibit the highest standards of honour at all times.
; str_npc10_2ary_morality_speech|My liege -- I can't say I like to see us {s21}. You should treat your men well, and they'll repay with interest.
; str_npc14_2ary_morality_speech|You should not let it bother you that you {s21}. Armies are made to do their leaders' bidding, and hardships are part of a soldier's life.
; str_npc15_2ary_morality_speech|You know, {playername}, it's none too reassuring to see how you just {s21}. If you can break your word to them, you can break your word to me, is how I figure it. 
; str_npc16_2ary_morality_speech|{My lord/My lady} -- just so you know, it's no problem by me that we {s21}. We do what we need to do to live, and they'd do the same to us if they were in our shoes.
; str_npc17_2ary_morality_speech|Are you out of your mind? The men need to see your bravery, not your cowardice. Go {s21} in your own time and show your men next time what a real {man/woman} is made of.
; str_npc18_2ary_morality_speech|How could you? By {s21} you're acting like my traiterous father. How can I ever trust you not to return me to him?
; str_npc19_2ary_morality_speech|...
; str_npc20_2ary_morality_speech|Maybe {s21} is your way to show your faith in the Heavens, but it is definately not mine. Please be carefull, for this behaviour only leads to evil.
; str_npc21_2ary_morality_speech|My friend, are we trying to travel the world or to cleanse it? By {s21} you really made me wonder if it was the right decision to be at your side.
; str_npc22_2ary_morality_speech|I'm a man of my word, swearing that those nobles would pay for their deeds. I thought you were a similar {man/woman}, but by {s21} you showed me otherwise. How disappointing.
; str_npc23_2ary_morality_speech|My friend, are we trying to travel the world or to ruin it?
; str_npc1_personalityclash_speech|{My lord/My lady}, no offense, but I'm a bit tired of Maron, who puts on airs like he's something better than me, an anointed knight! Why, he's just a merchant, and a poor one at that!
; str_npc2_personalityclash_speech|As you recall I was a merchant before I signed on with you. I respect men who make their living peacefully, risking all to bring goods for far away lands.
; str_npc3_personalityclash_speech|{My lord/My lady}, in my opinion, Drollo is a hard and savage beast. He speaks of nothing but the need to rape and pillage enemy villages!
; str_npc4_personalityclash_speech|Friend. The House of Paton is one of the most ancient and respected families in this part of the world, with a provenance dating back to the Old Ghiscari Empire. Yet Arratos openly shows me disrespect, and casts doubt on the provenance of my house, as if he wasn't the descendant of a whore and an escaped slave himself!
; str_npc5_personalityclash_speech|A moment of your time, {my lord/my lady}. Brynden seems to think me a common bandit, just because I have rewarded myself in the past to the legitimate spoils of war from travellers passing through {my lord/my lady} fathers lands. Bah! People have always paid for access with our ferry, and those who did not where no better than common outlaws.
; str_npc6_personalityclash_speech|None.
; str_npc7_personalityclash_speech|{playername}, I have done my best to put up with your followers' rude talk and filthy habits. But that one who calls himself Martyn Snow is beyond tolerance.
; str_npc8_personalityclash_speech|Just so you know, I cannot abide that insolent boy, Serol. Some minutes ago, he was remarking to our companions how the peasants of this region were more than usually slack-jawed and beetle-browed, and speculated that perhaps they had bred with aurochs.
; str_npc9_personalityclash_speech|{playername}, Drollo is a base braggart, a man with no respect for the honour of women. I am tired of hearing how he conquered this or that damsel. Forced her is more like it.
; str_npc10_personalityclash_speech|Excuse me, my liege. I hate to trouble you with such things, but I just wanted to let you know that I can't abide that fellow Garrett. Like all reachmen, he's a vile man, prone to all sorts of perversions.
; str_npc11_personalityclash_speech|Begging your pardon, but I can't keep silent. That man, Mavros... he's intolerable!.
; str_npc12_personalityclash_speech|{My lord/My lady}. Mavros, complained of headaches, a possible symptom of excess of sanguinity, though in his case, I imagine it's a headache brought on by an uncontrolled lust for fine wine. I thought to apply my leeches.
; str_npc13_personalityclash_speech|{My lord/My lady}, I weary of Gyrnir, who speaks nothing but bleak thoughts and is a constant dampener on every conversation.
; str_npc14_personalityclash_speech|Excuse me, {playername}. A few minutes ago, I had expressed the opinion that liberal use of the lash and occasional use of the gallows is essential to keep soldiers in line. Men without a healthy fear of their commanders are more likely to run from battle.
; str_npc15_personalityclash_speech|Excuse me. I hope you don't mind me telling you that in my opinion, that man Jasper is a danger to the party. He's an arrogant man, disrespectful of authority and the basic principles of the military art.
; str_npc16_personalityclash_speech|{My lord/My lady}. Just so you know, there's something funny about that  fellow. He makes strange scrawlings in the dirt, and makes these awful guttural sounds.
; str_npc17_personalityclash_speech|{playername}, have you seen Martyn? That bastard just stole one of my pouches, filled with locks of hair from all the women I have bedded. I was talking to your men, trying to teach them to be real warriors, when one of them pointed out that he saw him digging in one of my fourty-two money pouches. I immediately ran towards him, but he slipped away.
; str_npc18_personalityclash_speech|{playername}, are you the only one in this group I can really trust? I thought Saathos could be a friend, but all he does is laugh at my past.
; str_npc19_personalityclash_speech|...
; str_npc20_personalityclash_speech|Could I have a word with you about {s11}? I believe that she has been misguided, and led astray to wrong beliefs.
; str_npc21_personalityclash_speech|My friend, have I ever let you down? I'm just asking, for that traiterous Gyrnir seems to think I will betray you on a whim. How insulting! Has he never heard of the septon's word?
; str_npc22_personalityclash_speech|My liege, did you hear what Bennis just said? About the soldiers needing to fear the commander? It is the aristocracy all over again.
; str_npc23_personalityclash_speech|{playername}, did you hear what Bennis just said? About the soldiers needing to fear the commander? The man is a fool, and he'll be the ruin of all of us. Soldiers should admire and respect their commander, not fear him.
; str_npc24_personalityclash_speech|{playername}, that Fenna woman is a filthy harlot if ever I saw one. Worships trees and probably has a womans weak will! Why, you don't need her, not when you got brave Roddy in your guard! There once was a song about me! 'Brave and bold Roddy, rode forth from Chelsted! He was not afraid to die, oh brave Roddy! He was not at all afraid, to be killed in nasty ways! Brave, brave, brave, brave Roddy'! 
; str_npc25_personalityclash_speech|{playername}, that northern women is a filthy harlot if ever I saw one. Worships trees and probably has a womans weak will!

; str_npc1_personalityclash_speech_b|He is of common birth, and as such has no right to tell me what to do.
; str_npc2_personalityclash_speech_b|I don't much care to hear {s11} gloat about the caravans he has looted, or he plans to loot, like he has no respect for good honest trade.
; str_npc3_personalityclash_speech_b|I know that an army is not a sept, and that strong discipline is important, but I do believe that man enjoys cruelty for cruelty's sake. I hope you do not mind me saying so.
; str_npc4_personalityclash_speech_b|These are indeed sorry days if filthy slaves are allowed to mock their betters. That is all.
; str_npc5_personalityclash_speech_b|I told him, that if the Warrior's way bothers him so much, then he ought become a septon or a beggar and so not have to worry about such things. I hope you do not mind that I said such things.
; str_npc6_personalityclash_speech_b|None.
; str_npc7_personalityclash_speech_b|I do not care for how he stares at me around the campfire after a meal, as he picks his teeth. I believe I recognize him from my days as a squire. He is base and ignorant. I do not care to travel with such people.
; str_npc8_personalityclash_speech_b|Serol, that font of impudence, overheard me arguing that maybe he was half aurochs himself, and called me ignorant, and a savage, and other words I do not care to repeat. It was only out of respect for you that I refrained from cutting his throat then and there. I thought it only fit that I should warn you.
; str_npc9_personalityclash_speech_b|If he persists, I shall tell him that he is a base varlot, and if it comes to blows I will not apologize. That is all.
; str_npc10_personalityclash_speech_b|He's just a simple brigand, as far as I can tell. Winner of an archery contest, my arse. Reachmen are bad enough, but those who pretend to be honest are bloody intolerable. Anyway, I might have said something a bit sharp to him a minute ago. He seemed to take offense, anyway. I just thought you should know.
; str_npc11_personalityclash_speech_b|Just because he's used to the savage lifestyle of those dirty dornishmen, he thinks that everyone ought to get their hands dirty. I tell you, like all dornishmen, he is a base and perverted man!
; str_npc12_personalityclash_speech_b|But when I tried to afix them, he recoiled and struck me, and accused me of witchcraft. Pff. {playername}, I am deeply tired of attending to the complaints of such an ungrateful and ignorant lot.
; str_npc13_personalityclash_speech_b|I tire mightily of him, and the next time he begins droning on about how dreadful our existence is, I fear I might upend a barrel of ale over his head!
; str_npc14_personalityclash_speech_b|That chit Kanosos saw fit to admonish me for this. I will not have my methods questioned in front of the men, and I will not serve any commander who tolerates such insubordination in his company. Thank you for allowing me to speak my peace.
; str_npc15_personalityclash_speech_b|What's more, I suspect he's a thief. I found him going through my baggage and pawing some of my schematics, and he pulled a knife on me when I thought fit to object. A wise lord would not allow him in his company.
; str_npc16_personalityclash_speech_b|Fearing witchcraft, I asked him about it, and he just stared at me. Those eyes! So I had a look in his baggage, and found strange plans and diagrams. I think he's a warlock, {my lord/my lady}, and if I catch him trying to hex me he'll have a knife in his throat.
; str_npc17_personalityclash_speech_b|How can anyone make a decent living in this party when that thief is around? If I can get my hands on him, he won't do it again, I can assure you that much.
; str_npc18_personalityclash_speech_b|After trying to get closer for weeks, I finally dared to open up to him, and all he could do was laugh at me. That horrible rasping laugh! I tell you, when I looked into his eyes, I saw evil!
; str_npc19_personalityclash_speech_b|...
; str_npc20_personalityclash_speech_b|I recently talked to her, and discovered the differences in our ways, upon which I took the opportunity to correct her errors. The insults she hurled at me! I dare not to repeat them.  Later I discovered that she had gone through my baggage and ruined one of my holy scrolls!  If she stays any longer wih us, I fear I might resort to my old ways and kill her on sight.  Please, don't let that happen.
; str_npc21_personalityclash_speech_b|He quotes dead men to prove his point, but who cares what has been written a thousand years ago while we are alive today? I hope you'll use your common sense and leave Gyrnir behind at the first opportunity possible.
; str_npc22_personalityclash_speech_b|When I spoke my mind to him, he wanted to lash out on me! I will not ride out with people who act just like the knights who raped my sister. If you don't do something about it, I will find another company to help me with my revenge.
; str_npc23_personalityclash_speech_b|When I spoke my mind to him, he called me a bitch! I have a mind to geld the man, but as you command this band of warriors, I defer to you.

; str_npc2_personalityclash2_speech|If you don't mind, I'd prefer not to be deployed anywhere near Bennis, after what he said to me during that last battle.
; str_npc3_personalityclash2_speech|{My lord/My lady}. Since I have joined your company, I have tried hard to learn how to live like a soldier, and how to honour the the warrior. If I occasionally make mistakes, I would hope to be forgiven.
; str_npc4_personalityclash2_speech|I happened to exchange a few words with Arratos as we were dividing up the spoils of battle. Please inform him that when he speaks to me, he should call me 'My lord' or perhaps 'Your Grace,' or 'Your Magnificence,' but certainly not just 'Graznon.' I am of the blood of Old Ghiscar and Astapor!

; str_npc6_personalityclash2_speech|None.
; str_npc7_personalityclash2_speech|{playername} -- I have been searching my mind trying to remember where I have seen Martyn, the one who calls himself a descendant of the Dustins of Barrowton. As I watched him in action during that last battle, I suddenly remembered. He is a good fighter, but also a vicious one.
; str_npc8_personalityclash2_speech|{s11} is a most insolent man. I have tried to be polite, even friendly, only to have him rebuff me.
; str_npc9_personalityclash2_speech|I hope you do not mind me telling you this, but in my opinion {s11}, the merchant, does not know his place. During that last battle, he cut in front of me to engage a foe whom I had marked for my own.
; str_npc10_personalityclash2_speech|{My lord/My lady}, a question for you. Are you in charge of this company, or is it {s11}?
; str_npc11_personalityclash2_speech|I don't much care for that {s11}. After that last battle, he went around muttering some heathen incantation, as he went through the slain looking for loot.
; str_npc12_personalityclash2_speech|My liege. I can no longer abide the rank ignorance of {s11}. As I was treating the wounded during our last battle, he saw fit to disparage my use of milk of the poppy in relieving the pain while I conducted surgery, and of treating wounds with a poultice of honey.
; str_npc13_personalityclash2_speech|Hello, Your Grace! {s11} is a temperamental one, isn't he? During that last battle, I was merely having a friendly chat with our foes about their mothers as we exchanged swordblows, and it caused him to throw a fit!
; str_npc14_personalityclash2_speech|{s11} is incorrigibly indisciplined. During that skirmish, I called out to him that he should hold ranks with the rest of our battle array. He called back to me that I should 'get stuffed.'
; str_npc15_personalityclash2_speech|{My lord/My lady} -- I must tell you that I question {s11}'s medical credentials. As he was tending to our wounded after that last battle, I saw fit to remind him that the peerless Gerardys often advocated administering a distillation of beetroot, to restore the humor imbalance brought by loss of sanguinity.
; str_npc16_personalityclash2_speech|Beg your pardon. {s11} might be a good man, but he's not got the stomach to be a warrior, if you ask me.
; str_npc17_personalityclash2_speech|{playername}, I wonder why you still have {s11} around. I watched him during the battle, and noticed that he stayed behind the entire time. Of course a commander needs to have some overview, but he's not a lord out here: just a regular in your service.
; str_npc18_personalityclash2_speech|My dear {sir/madame}, I'm afraid I cannot tolerate the presence of {s11} any longer. During the last battle I was standing behind him and recognized his sword swing.

; str_npc2_personalityclash2_speech_b|The enemy was bearing down on us, and he says, 'Step aside, merchant, this is warriors work.' Next time I will step aside, and let him take a spear in the gut.
; str_npc3_personalityclash2_speech_b|After our last victory I was picking through the slain, and availed myself of one of our foe's purses. No sooner had I done so then {s11} came up behind me and struck it from my hands, saying that it was he who had made the kill, and thus he deserved the spoils. {My lord/My lady}, I could not tell in the heat of battle who had struck whom. If {s11} had simply told me that he deserved the purse, I would gladly have given it to him.
; str_npc4_personalityclash2_speech_b|I am of noble blood, and he is of the basest birth. He must remember his place. The House of Paton does not forget insults. The Harpy does not forget insults.
; str_npc5_personalityclash2_speech_b|When the loot was piled up after the last battle, I found among the enemy's baggage a very decent cooking pot. Often I had wished to find such a pot, so I could boil some of the stews that my fathers household used to warm their bellies during the winter. But Brynden grabs the pot, and tells me that I will not be allowed to 'taint' it with reachman food, and that it should properly belong to him. I yielded the pot to him, but I will not tolerate such disrespect in the future.

; str_npc7_personalityclash2_speech_b|Back when I lived in my lord grandfathers castle, I saw many a thief hanged. This man looks like those thieves.
; str_npc8_personalityclash2_speech_b|As we were cleaning our weapons, he almost hacked off my head when he stumbled!
; str_npc9_personalityclash2_speech_b|I appreciate that he is willing to risk his life in battle, but that alone does not make a nobleman. He is not of noble birth, and his family's wealth comes from commerce and usury. He may fight with us as an auxiliary, but should not attempt to steal glory from his betters.
; str_npc10_personalityclash2_speech_b|In that last battle he was shouting at me: 'Go forward, go back, hold the line.' When I told him to mind his own trimming he said he'd have me flogged.  {My lord/My lady}, that man is looking for a crossbow bolt in his groin, begging your pardon.
; str_npc11_personalityclash2_speech_b|He said it was a prayer of thanksgiving for victory, but it didn't sound like that to me. Captain, I don't want him raising up the Others to make trouble for us on our travels. I think you had best be rid of him
; str_npc12_personalityclash2_speech_b|{My lord/My lady}, if that man knew the slightest thing about medical matters, he would know that one should never undermine a patient's confidence in his maester, particularly not during a complicated operation. If you would be kind enough to dismiss him from this company, you would be doing all of us a great service.
; str_npc13_personalityclash2_speech_b|When all the dust settled, {s11} turned on me and told me not to 'tempt the wrath of the Heavens' with my 'hubris.'
; str_npc14_personalityclash2_speech_b|Such defiance of proper authority is a corrosive influence on our company, and I shall have him flogged if he does so again.
; str_npc15_personalityclash2_speech_b|{s11} responded that Gerardys was an 'antiquated know-nothing, only good as a dragon morsel.' My liege, no true maester would have such disrespect for the great maesters of the past. I do not believe you should employ such an obvious impostor.
; str_npc16_personalityclash2_speech_b|After our last scrap, I was slicing open the guts of some our foes to check for hidden gold, as one might do after a battle. He gagged and muttered that I was an 'animal.' I'll inspect his innards for contraband if he doesn't keep a civil tongue in his head.
; str_npc17_personalityclash2_speech_b|His attitude begins to irritate me. He might be of noble birth, but he has done nothing to earn his titles. Staying out of a fight to keep his armor shiny, complaining when his weapons get dirty: this arrogant prick is trouble all along.
; str_npc18_personalityclash2_speech_b|He has been to my village years ago, where he helped the village elder to obtain even more women to kill.  I told him I recognized him, so he struck me down to silence me.  No-one noticed in the heat of battle. Please, my dear {sir/madame}, don't let that monster anywhere near me again.
; str_npc19_personalityclash2_speech_b|...
; str_npc20_personalityclash2_speech_b|After our last victory -- the Heavens be praised -- I spotted her going through the dead bodies of our fallen foes, without paying the proper respect they deserve. When I tried to correct her, she just looked sheepishly at me, only to burst out in curses afterwards. You wouldn't believe the things she said to me!  She's bad luck, I say you, and will bring misfortune over our company. It'd be best to leave her at the next heathen village.
; str_npc21_personalityclash2_speech_b|I had pinned down an opponent, who begged me for mercy. It was that moment I recognised him as one of the former servants from my father's palace. Tears ran down our cheeks upon this spark of recognition, and I gave him my word to let him live if he fled the battlefield. After this was said, that monster of a {s11} stepped in and slit his throat without a warning! I'm afraid to sleep anywhere near him, my friend. It'd be best to let him go.
; str_npc22_personalityclash2_speech_b|After the last battle she insulted me beyond any words, saying that I'd better be one of her servants, else I would be as good as dead.

; str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech|My liege. Ser Jasper back there didn't do badly in that last fight at all. He's a good man, too.
; str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech|Your grace. I just wanted to tell you that Saathos may be a rough sort, and possibly quite mad, and I'll venture he's a thoroughgoing rogue as well, but I'm proud to call him my companion.
; str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech|Hello, {my lord/my lady}! I had just wanted to tell you that Berengar is a most gallant man. Did you see him in our last battle?
; str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech|Excuse me, my liege. I just wanted to say a word in praise of Bilaquo. He did well in that last battle, though not as well as me.
; str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech|That was a fine battle, {playername}! Jasper is a good man to have by our side in a fight!
; str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech|{My lord/My lady}! Sometimes I am troubled by all this bloodshed, although I know that proud lords must be humbled, and cruel men tamed, if we are to restore peace to the realm.
; str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech|I was just talking to Ser Bennis. He may be a bit rough, but I believe that he is a faithful friend.
; str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech|A fine battle that was, my liege. And I have to say, I admire the taunts that Martyn hurled at our enemy. They where quite witty.
; str_npc9_personalitymatch_speech|{playername}. Bilaquo acquitted himself well in that fight back there. A fine, modest man he is, if I dare say so myself.
; str_npc10_personalitymatch_speech|Ahoy, {playername}! I wish you joy of your victory! Say, Maron is not bad in a scrap, is he, for a man of his trade? Although I'm getting to be a bit of an old dog myself for this, he might yet learn a proper way of life.
; str_npc11_personalitymatch_speech|Ach, {my lord/my lady}! A fight like that one bloodies my draw finger! Still, we bloodied them well and good, didn't we?
; str_npc12_personalitymatch_speech|A bloody business, a bloody business -- although a necessary one, of course. Maron, I believe, shares my ambivalence about this constant fighting.
; str_npc13_personalitymatch_speech|You have earned your name today, oh valorous one! And Clavis, too! I like that one. He sings of valor when he charges into the enemy ranks, and it's a most proper behavior for a knight.
; str_npc14_personalitymatch_speech|{playername}. It is a pleasure going into battle with men like Roger by my side.
; str_npc15_personalitymatch_speech|{playername}. I was just having a word with Halbert after our last battle, and it strikes me that the man has got a good head on his shoulders.
; str_npc16_personalitymatch_speech|I was just having a chat with Drollo, as we picked through the bodies after our last little scrap.
; str_npc17_personalitymatch_speech|{playername}, while I was fighting in the frontline this battle I got finally a chance to speak to Serol. What a revelation it was to hear his story: I feel like I could write many poems about his exploits.
; str_npc18_personalitymatch_speech|Have I been wrong? I thought that everyone in the whole world was out there to kill me, you excluded of course, but now that I have spoken to Ser Roger, I'm not sure about that. He seems so nice and understanding.
; str_npc19_personalitymatch_speech|...
; str_npc20_personalitymatch_speech|The Heavens be praised that you enlisted Gyrnir in your company. He's a good fighter, and clearly tries to live a moral life, just like me.
; str_npc21_personalitymatch_speech|My friend, it's good to fight alongside Ser Jasper. He is brave, and most of all, honorable.
; str_npc22_personalitymatch_speech|My liege, have you heard Alyns story? About the abuse of power by his village elder? Her tale made my blood boil. How I wish I was there to tell him what I think of him.
; str_npc23_personalitymatch_speech|{playername}, have you seen Alyn? Ah, he's a handsome man, is he not? Makes a woman wish to put away the mace and pick up the gown.
; str_npc24_personalitymatch_speech|{playername}, have you seen {s11}? Ah, he's a handsome man, is he not? Makes a woman wish to put away the mace and pick up the gown.

; str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech_b|Without good honest souls like him to bring light into the world, knights like me would have a hard time in life, I'll warrant. I'm glad to have him with us.
; str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech_b|Based on how he did in that last fight, I'd say that I'd trust my back to him any day, although I'd still keep a hand on my purse.
; str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech_b|I also confess that I find him a truly delightful companion, a man of both wit and manners. Good day, {playername}.
; str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech_b|You chose well to enlist him in our company. He knows a thing or two about a fight, and also knows the importance of respecting his superiors, unlike some others I might mention.
; str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech_b|As for his other attributes, I find that he is a truer knight than many I have met.
; str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech_b|I must say that Halbert is a source of great comfort to me. I have told him of my past sins, and he told me that the Father is sure to forgive me.
; str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech_b|Ser Bennis is a true knight. I've been discussing the intricacies of handling the peasants, and he quite agrees with me, that we ought to punish them more often!
; str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech_b|He managed to include their geneology, their appearance, and their eating habits in a well-framed Old Valyrian quatrain. I personally prefer the saga, but we northerners respect poetic craftwork when we hear it.
; str_npc9_personalitymatch_speech_b|I rather like this fellow. He's good company!
; str_npc10_personalitymatch_speech_b|Heh. It just goes to show that your former way of life ain't everything, that enthusiasm also wins battles. I reckon he and I could teach the young puppies of the world how proper men act.
; str_npc11_personalitymatch_speech_b|Ser Roger in particular showed them a thing or two, I thought. Not bad for the pair of us, I think between us we killed half the enemies that came towards us!
; str_npc12_personalitymatch_speech_b|It saddens him deeply to take the lives of his fellow men, however just the cause. He and I have talked together of a brighter future, where in the realm is not shattered by war.
; str_npc13_personalitymatch_speech_b|I'm sure that in this splendid company, we'll all end up lords by the end of our days!
; str_npc14_personalitymatch_speech_b|He is a professional soldier, and though he may not be as fast on his feet as some others, he knows the wisdom of holding together in a disciplined battle-line. You showed good sense in bringing him into this company.
; str_npc15_personalitymatch_speech_b|War, like any other affair, requires careful planning and preparation, and a firm grasp of strategic principals. All other things being equal, the best trained army will win the battle, an observation that I think our last fight bears out. The men may curse him now, but they'll learn to thank him, I'll warrant.
; str_npc16_personalitymatch_speech_b|Have you heard of this Dothraki people? Fascinating stories he tells.
; str_npc17_personalitymatch_speech_b|To hear him tell it, he had to fight a hundred men to escape Pentos!
; str_npc18_personalitymatch_speech_b|I've heard tales of the knights of the green lands, but I never expected him to be so genial and honest.
; str_npc19_personalitymatch_speech_b|...
; str_npc20_personalitymatch_speech_b|His story might seem unbelievable -- especially with the way he fights, which I recognized last battle -- but at least he shook his old shackles off and tries to find a better way in life.
; str_npc21_personalitymatch_speech_b|When I talked to Ser Jasper after our last battle, I understood that he's been far away from home too. I feel we are similar souls, and destined to be friends, my friend.
; str_npc22_personalitymatch_speech_b|Maybe it's the way he talks, or the way he walks. I feel sorry for him. But I'm glad that there is at least one soul in this company that really understands me.
; str_npc23_personalitymatch_speech_b|I'll have to bring him back to Bear Island, he'd do well there, both in my bed and in the fields.
; str_npc24_personalitymatch_speech_b|Maybe it's the way he talks, or the way he walks. I'll have to bring him back to Bear Island, he'd do well there.
; str_npc25_personalitymatch_speech_b|Maybe it's the way he talks, or the way he walks. I'll have to bring him back to Bear Island, he'd do well there.

; str_npc28_personalitymatch_speech_b|Maybe it's the way he talks, or the way he walks. I'll have to bring him back to Bear Island, he'd do well there.
; str_npc1_retirement_speech|I'm a bit tired of marching up and down the land, shedding my blood for someone else's cause. The loot is good, but I think I've got enough of that, now. I'm going to head back to my village, take a wife, settle down, maybe raise horses, or find work with the local lord.
; str_npc2_retirement_speech|I'm getting a bit tired of the warrior's life. I'm going to invest my share of our loot into a cargo of goods -- furs, linens, velvets, fine Arbor wines probably -- and take them back to Slaver's Bay. I'd warrant the dragon queen would have a taste of Westerosi wine. I would like to thank you again for taking me on, and wish you the best of luck.
; str_npc3_retirement_speech|I am afraid I have something to tell you. I have decided that the warrior's life is not for me. I think I'll join the Faith, and become a septon.
; str_npc4_retirement_speech|I have fought with you honourably, as befits a son of the House of Paton, but I am not altogether satisfied with your leadership. I will go home to my ancestral estates, which are much in need of my services. Hopefully, the dragon slut has moved on by now.
; str_npc5_retirement_speech|{playername} -- since I have taken your coin, I have fought for you fiercely, and loyally. But you have not always repayed my service with the kind of leadership that I deserve. So I am going home, to see my father, wife, children, uncles, nephews, sisters and brothers again.
; str_npc6_retirement_speech|I joined this company in the hope that you would lead me out of darkness, and indeed I have found a measure of peace here. But I have some qualms about your leadership, and have begun to suspect that the path to peace can be found elsewhere.
; str_npc7_retirement_speech|I am tired of this squalid life of endless warfare, seeing men debased by fear, greed, lust, and a hundred other sins. I have money in my purse. I am going overseas to look for a better land than this. I assume that you will fare well without me.
; str_npc8_retirement_speech|I have fought in your shield wall, and done well by it. But your leadership is not always to my liking, and anyways I have another task. I will take what plunder I have won and sail to my familys old home on the Paps. Might be my brothers will forgive me.
; str_npc9_retirement_speech|We have fought well together, and earned ourselves much glory. But I have some reservations about your leadership, and at any rate have my patrimony to reclaim. I will be leaving you. Perhaps we will meet again.
; str_npc10_retirement_speech|I've had enough of tromping up and down the length and breadth of the world. I've got enough to buy a small bit of land somewhere, perhaps close to the Greenblood, so I think I'll give that a try. So long, and best of luck to you.
; str_npc11_retirement_speech|You did a lowborn man a great service by taking him into your company. But I'm afraid I'm finding that this life is not to my liking.
; str_npc12_retirement_speech|I've done all right in your company. I filled my belly, put some gold in my purse, and broadened my knowledge of wounds and injury -- I can't complain about that! But I think right now that service in this company is holding me back. I have a duty to share my findings with others, and for that I need to hire scribes, who are rare in in these parts.
; str_npc13_retirement_speech|As the luster of your name grows ever brighter, I fear that my own reputation will seem pale in comparison, as the moon is outshined by the sun. I have decided to strike out on my own. The very best of luck to you!
; str_npc14_retirement_speech|I would like to inform you that I wish to sever our relationship. I intend to seek alternative employment.
; str_npc15_retirement_speech|I appreciate that you took me on, but I'm not altogether happy about how things have worked out. I'm going to head off elsewhere -- maybe go home, maybe find another job, I haven't quite decided yet.
; str_npc16_retirement_speech|I've had good times in this company, and I've found myself a pretty trinket or two on the battlefield, but right now it isn't working out. I'm leaving you to go offer my talents to someone else.
; str_npc17_retirement_speech|It was good to fight alongside you, but the time has come to invest the money you gave me. I hope that you have learned from my company, and maybe one day we can team up again. Maybe then the roles of commander and hireling will be reversed.
; str_npc18_retirement_speech|I'm sorry, {playername}, but I'm afraid I can't stay any longer with your band. I've lost my trust in your companions and don't dare to risk them handing me over to my father. I thank you for your kindness.
; str_npc19_retirement_speech|Ah, {playername}, it grieves me so to say this, but I must retire from adventuring with you. My discoveries must be catalogued.
; str_npc20_retirement_speech|I'm sorry, but the Heavens have shown me a different path than the one you are taking. I'm afraid we'll have to part here. If we have enough faith, our paths may one day cross each other again.
; str_npc21_retirement_speech|We've seen the world together, haven't we, my friend? But I'm afraid our paths have to part  this day. I've found a trace of my father's servants. I want to follow them, in the hope I might find a way back to the old days, and bring my people back under my banner. Unfortunately it lands to the opposite direction of where you're heading. May our paths once cross each other again!
; str_npc22_retirement_speech|Where are you heading, {playername}? I picked up a trail of those vile nobles, and they went that way. Ah, well, I'll just go my own way if I can't convince you to come along to that direction. It isn't like you ever listened to my suggestions after all...
; str_npc23_retirement_speech|Ah, {playername}, I'm afraid I'll have to return to mother. It's been far too long, and I've seen enough of the world.
; str_npc24_retirement_speech|Ah, {playername}, I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this kind of life. I think I'll return to Chelsted, and live out my days.
; str_npc25_retirement_speech|Look, {playername}, an apple! REND THE FLESH, REND, REND, REND, spill the blood!
; str_npc26_retirement_speech|I'm done.
; str_npc27_retirement_speech|I'm done.
; str_npc28_retirement_speech|I'm done.
; str_npc1_rehire_speech|{My lord/My lady}! -- it's good to see you again. I know we had our differences in the past, but to tell you the truth, those were some of the best days I've known. And, to tell you the truth, I've had a bit of difficulty finding work. Listen, if you'd be willing to have me back, I'd be willing to sign up with your company again.
; str_npc2_rehire_speech|{My lord/My lady}! It's good to see you again. But I'll confess -- I've been looking for you. I bought a load of goods like I told you I would, loaded them up, and I would have taken them all the way to Slaver's Bay -- but wouldn't you know it, I was attacked by a band of corsairs, outside Volantis, and lost it all. I guess I'm just destined to fight for my fortune. Also, people tell me that you've done very well for yourself. So tell me, {playername}, would you have me back?
; str_npc3_rehire_speech|Well, hello {my lord/my lady}! It is very good to see you again. I have not fared so well since we parted, I am afraid. My mother's family, whom I hoped would give me a start in trading, have not been as welcoming as I have hoped. I receive nothing but lectures from my aunts, on how I have ruined my prospects for marriage by taking service in a mercenary company. Perhaps I am better suited to war than to commerce, to share a meal over a campfire with rough fellows than to drink wine with the merchants of Oldtown. {playername}, I must ask you -- will you take me back?
; str_npc4_rehire_speech|Why hello, {my lord/my lady}. It's been a while. You've done well for yourself, I hear. For my part, I've been having some difficulties coaxing a living from my estates -- locusts, bad rains, unruly serfs, oh, and a slave rebllion followed by a dragon attack that seared the greater part of my family. I thought I might take up the sword once more. I know there's been some bad blood between us, but I'd be honoured to fight in your ranks once again.
; str_npc5_rehire_speech|{playername}! Your fame grows ever greater -- even as far as my fathers keep. I've come back again, hoping you might forget any harsh words I had spoken, to see if I could fight with you once again.
; str_npc6_rehire_speech|It is good to see you, {playername}. Everywhere I go, men are in awe of your deeds. I have not had it so well since I left.  Will you allow me to serve with you once again?
; str_npc7_rehire_speech|{My lord/My lady}! It is good to see you. Forgive what I may have said when we parted. I joined a caravan out of King's Landing, bound for Horn Hill, but it was overtaken by outlaws and after my ransom I was set free here. There may be better places in the world than this, but I have yet to see them. So I think, if it is my lot to live here, then your company is as good a livelihood as any. Will you have me back?
; str_npc8_rehire_speech|Greetings to you, {playername}. I was wondering if the harsh words spoken between us in the past could be forgotten. I could not find enough men to crew a longship, and those whom I gathered quickly got bored and wandered off -- not, I will add, before they drank away such gold as I had accumulated. So I thought back to the battles we fought together. Those were good days, and profitable ones too.
; str_npc9_rehire_speech|My dear, dear {playername}! So good it is to see you! I have sought service with the lords of this land, but have been most grieviously disappointed. Half of them ask me to collect debts from fellow lords, as though I were a banker's errand boy, or chase down his serfs, as though I were a farm overseer. One even asked me to murder one of his creditors! So I killed him instead! I have looked for you, to see if you would wish me to join you again.
; str_npc10_rehire_speech|{My lord/My lady}! It's good to see you. You see, it turns out I'm not much of a farmer. Too soft on the hired hands, I figure. I let them rob me blind. I guess fighting is what I know best. So tell me, are you still looking for good men?
; str_npc11_rehire_speech|{My lord/My lady}! So good to see you! People say that you've been making gold hand over foot. I'm a fidgety bag of bones, I'll admit. I left you because I wasn't satisfied with the warrior's life, but I spend a bit of time in town and I realize that there are worse things in life than a full belly, honest companions, and the joy of seeing the enemy run before you. Especially with my luck with the dices. So, would you be hiring again
; str_npc12_rehire_speech|{playername}! It's a fine thing to see an honest face like yours. This world is full of lies. I went home to publish my findings, hired some scribes and made a handful of codices, and waited for the commissions. But it turns out that the Citadel don't care about real medical knowledge rather than warmed-over Gerardys. And publishers -- let me tell you, you never saw anyone so unscrupulous. They rent the books out chapter to by chapter to apprentices to copy, but half of them aren't returned, and those that are have pages soaked in wine, and there's no longer a complete copy of my work anywhere. I'll keep trying, but first I need a bit of money in my pocket. Are you looking for a man trained in the Citadel?
; str_npc13_rehire_speech|Well hello there. I had been hoping to see you again. Everywhere I go, I hear tales and songs of your deeds. I will admit that I felt a twinge of regret that we had parted ways, and, I'll confess, a twinge of jealousy as well at your reputation. I thought that once again I might fight by your side, and thus bask in the reflection of your glory. Perhaps we might ride together again, for a little while?
; str_npc14_rehire_speech|{playername}! It is good to see you. When last we parted, I was ready to swear that I would not serve you again, but perhaps I judged you too harshly. All over, men sing your praises. I have tried serving in other lords' armies, and believe me, what I have seen of them restores my opinion of your leadership. As my father taught me to say 'Ki jini anha astak asqoy, anha, Drollo ki Ogo'. If you would have me in your company, I would fight for you again.
; str_npc15_rehire_speech|Why hello, {playername}. I can't say I'm entirely displeased to see you. You see, I took on another contract before I left, and sure enough, when it came time to collect the pay, the lord had nothing but talk and excuses and petty little complaints about my handiwork. I can't say I was always happy in your company, but at least I put gold directly into my purse after every battle. You still offering work?
; str_npc16_rehire_speech|{My lord/My lady}! I find myself lordless, having bedded the daughter of my last lord. Mayhaps you seek to hire brave knights?
; str_npc17_rehire_speech|{playername}! It's been a while since we last spoken. I still remember the smell of the battlefields you led us on, the sound of coins exchanging ownership as we traded our way from city to city and the feeling of rescpect we earned with each move we made. Things are going easy for me lately. Too easy. The money is soundly invested, and I've got some men working on my farms. For me there's nothing left to do. What do you think, shall we revive old times?
; str_npc18_rehire_speech|What a cruel world it is out there! No one believes me, and they all want to return me to my father. Like that will do any good. {playername}, could you show me your mercy once again and let me join your protection once more?
; str_npc19_rehire_speech|Ah, {playername}. Good to see you. Mind if I join you again?
; str_npc20_rehire_speech|The Heavens be praised that we meet again. It is so much easier to stay at the right path in your company. I now know that for sure. If you still appreciate me, I'd like to join your side once again.
; str_npc21_rehire_speech|How fortunate I find you back, my friend! The trace I followed only led to a dead end. If you won't mind, I'd rather join your side again and travel the world together, like we used to do.
; str_npc22_rehire_speech|Ah, {playername}. I'd hate to admit it, but you were right. The trace I followed led to nowhere. I'd like to join your company again, and this time I promise to heed your words more than I used to do.
; str_npc23_rehire_speech|Ah, {playername}. Still travelling around the world, are you? I'd like to rejoin your merry band of rogues, if you don't mind.
; str_npc24_rehire_speech|Help, {playername}! I've quite run out of coin!
; str_npc25_rehire_speech|Help, {playername}! Where am I?
; str_npc26_rehire_speech|I guess I'll join you again.
; str_npc27_rehire_speech|I guess I'll join you again.
; str_npc28_rehire_speech|I guess I'll join you again.
; str_npc1_home_intro|{playername}! Those are the haunted ruins of Harrenhal!.
; str_npc2_home_intro|We're approaching Pentos. That's where I was headed when that big-eared demon took my ship!
; str_npc3_home_intro|Can you smell that? Lemon trees, apples and crocus flowers, it's the scent of Oldtown! I spent many a happy summer here when I was a boy, playing in the gardens of my mother's family while my father was away fighting as a mercenary.
; str_npc4_home_intro|Ah, Volantis. Astapor is certainly the greatest city in the world, but I concede that Volantis has a certain charm. At least the slaves of this place knows to respect the old blood.
; str_npc5_home_intro|{playername}! That over there is the pool that Florian saw Jonquil and the six maidens bathe themselves in!
; str_npc6_home_intro|Look, {playername}! That's the great castle of Casterly Rock, home of the Lannisters!.
; str_npc7_home_intro|Look, {playername}, over that hill! It's the twin towers of my grandfathers castle!.
; str_npc8_home_intro|Hmf. Do you hear that? The silence and the gulls. Do you see the desolation and the bleakness? We're close to the Fingers, the most godforsaken place in the world.
; str_npc9_home_intro|Behold! The bay of Braavos, the smelliest, dirtiest, ugliest of all the bays!.
; str_npc10_home_intro|D'you smell that fresh air, {playername}? This was my home, before I went in search of coin and battles, in that order. It's good to be up close to the river again. It's the smell of freedom. This is the cradle of Dorne, here at the outskirts of Planky Town.
; str_npc11_home_intro|I see the mountains. We must be getting near home.
; str_npc12_home_intro|We're passing by the site of one of my greatest medical triumphs, if that interests you.
; str_npc13_home_intro|Ah, the ruins of Castamere! Such a lovely castle it once was, supposedly, at the foot of the Mountains. I'm sure you're familiar with the tale of Lord Reyne? You have, without a doubt, heard that song Lord Tywin had made after his destruction of the castle.
; str_npc14_home_intro|Do you see that city up there, on the spur over the valley? Norvos? I spent an entire winter there some years back, trying to train the city watch.
; str_npc15_home_intro|You see that castle up on the hill? Ten Towers, it's called. I did some work there, not long ago. It's not as showy as some of the other castles in this land, but it's the finest stonework you ever saw.
; str_npc16_home_intro|Aye, {playername}, do you see those? Those are the Stones of the Mud King. We must be getting near to my birthplace.
; str_npc17_home_intro|Tyrosh... One of the few cities where I haven't been run out by an enraged magister and his dirty guard.
; str_npc18_home_intro|I must warn you, {playername}. Behind these hills lies Blackhold, the village I ran away from.
; str_npc19_home_intro|'In the darkness, smoke falls like rain! The flames are cold!' An old man once told me that. Ah, I have no idea what it means.
; str_npc20_home_intro|The Sorrows... Home to bandits, and much, much worse.
; str_npc21_home_intro|Ah, my friend: the town of Lys. The place my forefather nearly burned to the ground.
; str_npc22_home_intro|Look {playername}! That's Vulture's Roost!
; str_npc23_home_intro|Look {playername}! That's Winterfell!
; str_npc24_home_intro|Look {playername}! That's Chelsted!
; str_npc25_home_intro|Look {playername}! I've seen this place before! PLAY WITH THE SKULLS!
; str_npc26_home_intro|{playername}, that over there is the Whispers.
; str_npc27_home_intro|Ah, the Dreadfort. Or, well, most people would run screaming from this place. Not go 'ah', as if they're awed by it. Though I guess you would be awed by the Dreadfort, it's big. Nasty place though.
; str_npc28_home_intro|That's Tumbleton over there. Dreadful place. The whores are old, the wine older and the dice filled with lead.
; str_npc1_home_description|Truth be told, the stories of Harrenhal are vastly exaggerated. The ghosts of Harren the Black and his sons haunting the castle, engulfed in flames, and mad lady Lothston sending out bats to bring home naughty children for her cookpots, bah!.
; str_npc2_home_description|People say that the Pentoshi are a bunch of treacherous money-grubbers, but they have a good head for trade, if you ask me. They make the people up and down the coast grow flax, which they weave here into linen. It can't compete with Volantene silks and velvets as a luxury fabric, but it makes good summertime wear and you can use it for the sails of ships. More importantly, linen was one of the few goods that someone else in Essos wasn't already making, if you can believe that.
; str_npc3_home_description|Oldtown has dry winters and hot summers, but the people here build great cisterns to water their crops. They grow grapes -- wine from Oldtown is famous, {playername} -- and those who can afford it make walled gardens, where fruit trees grow in abundance, and we sit at night listening to music, or playing chess, or merely sniff the night air.
; str_npc4_home_description|While my house has never traded extensively with the Volantenes, I still think favorably of them. They know how keep their filthy slaves in check! And they train the best sluts outside of Lys. I myself once had the pleasure of experiencing a whore trained in the ways of the seven sighs. What a night, though her cunt was much too used for my taste.
; str_npc5_home_description|Imagine that! Riding along from tourney to tourney, never loosing a match, and on top of that, you spot the fairest maidens in the land, naked as the day they where born!
; str_npc6_home_description|What an impossing sight! I've seen many of the castles in Westeros, but I never imagined anything close to this!.
; str_npc7_home_description|Look at those high walls, and well-guarded crenelations. Truly, the Crossing is one of the greatest castles in Westeros! I used to swim in that river as a child, and I had my first woman in those trees over there.
; str_npc8_home_description|You haven't heard of this place? No surprise. The Fingers is the most remote part of the Vale of Arryn, and while they might have been somewhat pleasant once, they certainly are not today. During one of the frequent wars between the King in the North and the King of Mountain and Vale, a northern army landed on The Fingers, and systematically raped, pillaged and burned everything in sight. The Fingers have been a desolate place ever since.
; str_npc9_home_description|The Braavosi is a vile bunch, all of them descended from slaves, none of them washing more than once a day. Hmf, I shudder to even think of it. And they don't allow slavery! Even impossed it on Pentos, in that war they won through treachery and deceit!
; str_npc10_home_description|In the days of my ancestors, when Valyria still ruled the world, the Rhoynar led an army against the dragonlords. They were utterly obliterated, and so Queen Nymeria sailed, with all her people, across the Narrow Sea and landed in Dorne, where she took Mors Martell as her husband and brought all of Dorne under their joint rule.
; str_npc11_home_description|I'm from a small village close to Horn Hill. You know the saying, {playername} -- 'Barley grown in Horn Hill is made into ale in Oldtown, and we're all the better for it.' Not sure what that means, {playername}, but it's true about the barley. And wheat, and oats. We grow more grain here in the shadow of the Tarlys than all the rest of Westeros put together, and our ale is the best, too. You can see it in the soil here -- rich and black, and smells of good harvests and full bellies.
; str_npc12_home_description|The old knight of Stonedance, Ser Meribald Massey, had the dropsy, and had requested a maester from Oldtown to treat him. Like a typical citadel-educated healer, he went right to Ellendor for a cure. Ellendor recommends mercury for dropsy. Now, most of Ellendor's writings were useless back in the days of the Targaryen kings, when they were first written down, and they're doubly worthless today, but sometimes he hits upon the right cure by chance: mercury does cure some kinds of dropsy in small doses. However, mercury in large doses is poison, something that the Ellendor-worshippers never grasped.
; str_npc13_home_description|They say lord Tywins father was a foolish and weak man. Though they do not say that to Tywin Lannister. Anyhow, the lords Reyne and Tarbeck rebelled against their liege lord, though I forget why. Probably due to some silly thing, like a woman or gold.
; str_npc14_home_description|I say 'trying' because in my opinion, Norvoshi don't take well to discipline. Finest archers you ever saw, and good riders too, but they have no stomach for fighting in ranks. Their skills serve them well enough against brigands and sellswords, particularly when they can hide behind walls, but the Dothraki can match them arrow for arrow, and I've seen a khalasar cut through their infantry like a knife through butter.
; str_npc15_home_description|Like most castles that last around here, it's got foundations that are as old as the land itself. You can't see them any more with all the rebuilding, but the slabs are the size of a house. They must have utilized giants back in those days, because I don't see how they moved those things otherwise. Beautiful location, too -- Ten Towers sits right in front of the mines of Harlaw, which allows the lord to charge a pretty penny in tolls.
; str_npc16_home_description|Supposively, those stones where set up by old king Mudd, who ruled the Riverlands thousands of years ago. He was supposed to be unbeatable in battle, but he lost his last one. Took an arrow through the nose. His castle was named... well, no one knows, but we call the remains Oldstones.
; str_npc17_home_description|Before I met you, I travelled for a few months through Essos. Lords and ladies flocked to hear me sing! But alas, the rulers of the Free Cities are a jealous bunch! They always found some reason to throw me out of their manses, be it my beautiful voice or the effect I had on their beautiful daughters.
; str_npc18_home_description|It used to be a prosperous place amidst the rocks. We all respected and loved our village elder, like he deserved. He always traveled hence and forth between the neighboring villages, to improve our standing. One day he had forgotten something, and returned early, only to find his wife in bed with a large thrall. Immediately he swung his sword and killed them both.
; str_npc19_home_description|The same man sold me an excellent manticore shell though, so it was not an entirely useless discovery.
; str_npc20_home_description|These are the ruins of Chroyane, the Festival City. That over there is the Bridge of Dreams, and the large palace, or the ruins of a large palace, is the former Palace of Love. Chroyane was the pride of the Rhoynar.
; str_npc21_home_description|I hear that the Lyseni still hold an annual offering, to celebrate the fact that the entire city did not perish in that dreadful fire. Truly, wildfire is demon work.
; str_npc22_home_description|Vulture's Roost was the seat of the Vulture King. He rose up in rebellion during the reign of Daeron the Second, proclaiming himself king.
; str_npc23_home_description|Winterfell has been the seat of the Starks for thousands of years. Bran the Builder raised it with the help of magic and crowned himself the first King in the North.
; str_npc24_home_description|People say this is where Aemon the Dragonknight was born! And my uncle used to tell me how Garth Greenhand was buried beneath our farm!
; str_npc25_home_description|Where do I know this place from, {playername}? What are we doing here?
; str_npc26_home_description|It's where the Kings of Crackclaw Point used to have their seat. Some of the smallfolk tell a silly story about wizards, severed heads and giant knights when they hear about the place.
; str_npc27_home_description|The Boltons arguably have a reputation that's worse than reality, but that Roose... and his bastard... they're not very nice people is what I'm getting at.
; str_npc28_home_description|But that's to be expected. The people still wail over the Sack. And it's been almost two hundred years! To hear the locals tell it, 'twas only a fortnight ago that the Betrayers descended on the town with their dragons.
; str_npc1_home_description_2|Still, there's no denying that every house to hold the castle has met with an unfortunate end. House Hoare, Qoherys, Strong, Harroway, Lothston are all gone, and I hear that lady Whent has died as well. Murdered, more like it, when the Lannisters took the castle. Yes, the castle might not be haunted, but it's a bad place even so, {playername}.
; str_npc2_home_description_2|I had loaded up on saffron, cinnamon, cloves, peppers and other spices and a chest full of fine Arbor vine. I estimated that I could buy linens, furs, velvet, iron and wool, and the extra ships to carry them back, and I'd still make a profit. I just hadn't figured in lord Stannis, who apparently don't care for the common man.
; str_npc3_home_description_2|The poets call Oldtown the most beautiful city in the world, and I think for once that they do not exaggerate. How could they, with the Citadel, the Starry Sept and the Hightower right in front of them!
; str_npc4_home_description_2|The city is ruled by the elected triarchs, three each year. Ever since the Bleeding Years, and the War of Dominion, the Volantenes have kept to their trade and stayed out of war, in no great part thanks to the squabbling of the triarchs.
; str_npc5_home_description_2|I guess some men are truly favored by the gods. Say, did you ever hear the story about Florian the Fool, and his fair maiden Jonquil? No? I don't believe it, every child in Westeros have heard that tale at one point or another! Florian was a brave and homely knight, who one day spied the fair Jonquil bathing in this very pool. He was so captivated that he set out to slay the King of Cracklaw Point, who had been terrorizing the countryside, to gain her favor. When he finally completed his quest, Jonquils father gave him her hand in marriage, but a year later they where both dead! The King had sons, and they stormed in at the wedding feast, intent on revenge. Florian managed to kill all three of them, but not before Jonquil had been hit by an arrow. Consumed by grief, he fell on his own sword!
; str_npc6_home_description_2|They say that the caverns beneath the keep is filled with weapons, vaults stacked with golden coins and supply rooms filled with years worth of provisions. And look at the surrounding land! Never have I seen such rich grape groves, or such well-tended fields of wheat.
; str_npc7_home_description_2|Truly, these lands are the most prosperous and well-governed in all of Westeros! Oh, did I mention that already? Excuse me, but I feel a special kinship with these rolling hills and deep forests, after all, my father is a trueborn son of lord Walder Frey!
; str_npc8_home_description_2|The singers say that it was in retaliation for King Harrold and his men abducting and raping the bethroted of King Edderion, the one they called The Bridegroom. I don't care either way, but they could have left a few trees to smoother this blasted wind!
; str_npc9_home_description_2|Pah, I can smell that swampy city now, it's like a day old fish that's been raped by a scallop! We better avoid this town, {playername}, one is sure to catch a sudden case of slashed throat if I have to stay near this dirty place.
; str_npc10_home_description_2|Look at how the Orphans sail their painted ships up and down the river. It's customary for the children to meet travellers with songs and dancing, and they are generally a peaceful sort. They mostly trade up and down the river, picking fruits, selling dyes and doing the odd farm job. And the have astonishing knowledge of the healing arts, many of their midwives being more skilled than even the maesters.
; str_npc11_home_description_2|Truth be told, I can't quite remember why I left in the first place. Hah! Of course I can! The whores in these parts are old and wrinkled, and their cunts as dusty as the prison of Jak o' the Shadows, heh. Whatever that means. As I told you, {playername}, this land is old, and many of the sayings are older still. I never understood half of what my father told me, and I suspect that neither did he.
; str_npc12_home_description_2|The difference between poison and cure is the dose. You tell that to everyone you meet, and tell them you heard it first from Brynden the Wise. People think that all the wisdom worth knowing was written in old valyrian, but I say you can learn twice as much from village midwives and careful examination of nature than from the entire Citadel library. That's why they threw me out of the Citadel, although in retrospect that was a blessing. Anyway, I put that lord back on his feet, and he availed me of a sack of gold and the corpse of a freshly hanged criminal to dissect. Ha! To think of the lengths I had to go to get specimens back in those days.
; str_npc13_home_description_2|I think they thought that lord Tytos was so meek he'd just cave over, but they hadn't reckoned with young Tywin. He can't have been more than seventeen at the time! He destroyed their combined armies, and laid siege to Castamere and Tarbeck. When the walls finally fell to his catapults, lady Reyne approached him on her knees, her husband dead, and pleaded for the life of her young sons. Tywin Lannister had their infant bodies put on spikes before her, and then had her executed.
; str_npc14_home_description_2|But that's the usual story in these parts, is it not? These fat magisters, archons and what not, they all fear the khalasars, and cover behind their high walls. If they where to properly train an army of pikemen, with archers and crossbowmen behind them, why, I think the next khal to come by would be in for a surprise.
; str_npc15_home_description_2|And here's the funny thing -- old lord Harlaw was a fickle man, and he changed his designs a dozen times. Ten Towers is actually ten different castles, welded together. Anyhow, despite this, the castle is surprisingly defendable. I imagine that any enemy would have a hard time conquering this particular piece of the Iron Islands.
; str_npc16_home_description_2|Westeros is littered with remnants of the past. Essos too. I guess the world always moves on.
; str_npc17_home_description_2|They don't appreciate talent, those fat fish mongers. Bah!
; str_npc18_home_description_2|The fact that she had cheated on him drove him mad, and he started to demand the strangest things. In the end he took a new girl every night, only to have her hanged in the morning to prevent her being unfaithfull to him. Everyone in the village just let him get away with it! I'd rather stay out of sight when we pass through here, if you won't mind.
; str_npc19_home_description_2|Ever seen a manticore, {playername}? They're supposed to live on an island in the Jade Sea, but the natives refuse to tell us which one.
; str_npc20_home_description_2|When the dragonlords descended on prince Garin, he led more than two hundred thousand men against them. They destroyed his army and took him captive, put him in a golden cage, and mocked him. The continued laughing as he called on Mother Rhoyne to drown the invaders, but when the massive tidal wave descended on the invaders, their laughter ceased. It is said that the spirit of the invaders became the shrouded mist that covers these parts, and that prince Garin became the Shrouded Lord.
; str_npc21_home_description_2|I don't think they'd take kindly to a Parren in their midst, my lord. We should move on.
; str_npc22_home_description_2|Supposively, he was quite mad, often pretending to be a vulture himself, going around the castle with feathers stuck to his head, and eating rotten meat.
; str_npc23_home_description_2|King Rodrik was the King in the North who challenged the ironborn to a wrestling match over Bear Island. He wrestled a hundred man to the ground, one after the other, until everyone of the reavers where defeated, and left Bear Island. King Rodrik then granted Bear Island to House Mormont, and they've held it as vassals of the Starks ever since.
; str_npc24_home_description_2|And I've heard it told that Jaehaerys the Wise called this the most beautiful village in all the realm! And my uncles used to tell me the tale of how the remains of Vermithor, the great wyrm called the Bronze Fury, was buried under that large hill over there!
; str_npc25_home_description_2|Who am I!
; str_npc26_home_description_2|But the Whispers are not named after whispering heads. The sound comes from the sea flooding the caves beneath the cliffs.
; str_npc27_home_description_2|Roose always kept tidings from reaching the Starks, but the houses closer to the Dreadfort heard the stories. But what could we do, rebel against our overlords?
; str_npc28_home_description_2|Sure, the Sack was horrible, but it's been a generations since the last person lived who could remember it, so I say they'd ought to get over it!
; str_npc1_home_recap|I was born in a small hamlet close to Summerhall, {playername}
; str_npc2_home_recap|I was born in Duskendale, {playername}, a couple of years before that dreadful defiance business. My entire family was away when lord Darklyn rebelled, else I would not have been here today. Say what you will of Lord Tywin, but if you're going to defy him, you better have an army at your back.
; str_npc3_home_recap|I used to live in my father's house in Oldtown, but I spent much of my childhood in the rivers and the sea, swimming.
; str_npc4_home_recap|My ancestral and glorious home lies in Astapor, looking out over the Bay of Grief, towards the smoking ruins of Valyria.
; str_npc5_home_recap|I was born in the low plains of the Reach, close to Goldengrove.
; str_npc6_home_recap|My family lives close to Barrowton, but I doubt they want anything to do with me.
; str_npc7_home_recap|I was born in a hovel in the fens, not far from {s21}.
; str_npc8_home_recap|I was born on one of the islands adjacent to The Paps. Imagine that, being born on an island less important than The Paps...
; str_npc9_home_recap|I am from the mighty city of Pentos, certainly the cleanest of all the Free Cities!
; str_npc10_home_recap|Born and raised in the hills surrounding the Greenblood, {playername}, and I hope to settle down there one day, perhaps in a small manse.
; str_npc11_home_recap|I was born in a small, and I say that with an emphasis, village close to Horn Hill. That makes me a full-blooded reachman, if nothing else.
; str_npc12_home_recap|Oh, my father was a very minor knight, in service to house Crane. Lived most of my life in Oldtown, but now I travel the world in search of medical lore.
; str_npc13_home_recap|Oh, I was actually born in Ashford, {playername}, though my father made his home at Standfast.
; str_npc14_home_recap|I am the younger son of Khal Ogo.
; str_npc15_home_recap|I'm from Braavos. But Westeros is where the money is to be made, these days, if your trade is siegecraft.
; str_npc16_home_recap|Why, {playername}, I was born in Fairmarket, but my father lost his land to a scheming relative and had to put himself in bond to a nearby lord. That's how I became a squire, a way too soothe my father in his sorrow over loosing our old keep.
; str_npc17_home_recap|I'm from the court of Lys, but I haven't been there since I was a boy.
; str_npc18_home_recap|I ran away from Blackhold, where the village elder terrorizes the women.
; str_npc19_home_recap|I was born in the Queen of Cities. Qarth!

; str_npc1_kingsupport_1|That's a great idea, {playername}. All these merchants and archons and magisters who rule now, with their prisons and gibbets and scaffolds, the whippings and brandings and hangings for any man who might be driven by the crying of his children to steal a loaf of bread, or maybe a horse -- This realm deserves something better.
; str_npc2_kingsupport_1|Well, {playername} -- I'd support you. I think you'd give this world the kind of enlightened rule which it has long needed.
; str_npc3_kingsupport_1|Well, {my lord/my lady} -- I would worry for you. Our histories tell us that power tends to corrupt. But in the end, I am comforted by the mercy and judgment you have shown so far.
; str_npc4_kingsupport_1|Well, {playername}, I think that you would be the kind of {king/queen} that well-born nobles such as myself would be proud to follow into battle...
; str_npc5_kingsupport_1|A fine idea, {playername} - you have shown that you know how to govern men. Mind that you govern them justly, though...
; str_npc6_kingsupport_1|I cannot judge the legal merits of your claim. However, I think that unlike the other sovereigns here, you have the capacity to unify this land -- and that would put a stop to these endless wars, between kingdom and kingdom, noble and noble, and brother and brother, that have brought us all into disgrace in the eyes of all the gods.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_1|Yes -- you'll do well. You know how to treat bandits and ruffians.
; str_npc8_kingsupport_1|The tale of Aegon the Conquerer tells us that a man who does great deeds, beyond those of the other men of his time, may claim the throne. I'd say that you could make that claim.
; str_npc9_kingsupport_1|Very good, {my lord/my lady}. I'm a Pentoshi by blood, but the magisters never stood for me when I was cheated of my inheritance. So I don't owe them anything, and I say, 'Let the rule go to the most valiant!' Which would be you, {playername}.
; str_npc10_kingsupport_1|Well, {playername}, I suppose there must be {kings/kings and queens}, and if there must be {kings/kings and queens}, then you would be as good a {king/queen} as any...
; str_npc11_kingsupport_1|Why, that's a fine idea, {playername}! I suppose I shall have to learn to call you 'Your Majesty', or 'Your Grace', then...
; str_npc12_kingsupport_1|I am sure that you would make a fine king, {playername}. I flatter myself that I am a good judge of character, and you have demonstrated a capacity for compassion that far exceeds that of these others who call themselves monarchs.
; str_npc13_kingsupport_1|That would be a fine thing, village 114! Many is the tale of the hero who has proven his worthiness to wear a crown through valor. Perhaps you know the song of Rand, son of Tam, who rose from obscurity to become king of the whole world. A splendid tale!
; str_npc14_kingsupport_1|Well, {playername}, the heavens have instituted a hierarchy in this world, and normally I would have no truck with usurpation. But I also think that the kings of this land are a weak and sorry lot, not worthy of the name of king, and that leaves the crown free to be taken by a better {man/ruler}, such as yourself.
; str_npc15_kingsupport_1|Well, you pay your men on time, when you can, generally speaking. That's the best qualification for kingship there is, in my book. You show some respect for the rights of others.
; str_npc16_kingsupport_1|Why not, {playername}? I'm sure you'd make a fine {king/queen} -- and of course I'd hope you remember the people like myself who did you a pretty turn on your scramble to the throne.
; str_npc17_kingsupport_1|Don't sweat it, you'd make an excellent {king/queen}.
; str_npc18_kingsupport_1|You've always been so kind: I think you'd make a fair ruler.
; str_npc19_kingsupport_1|You've always been just. I think you'd make a fair ruler.
; str_npc20_kingsupport_1|As long as you praise the Heavens, nothing will stand in your way. I think you'd be a fine ruler.
; str_npc21_kingsupport_1|As a noble myself I can recognize royalty in an instant, and I dare say you are one of the finest I've met.
; str_npc22_kingsupport_1|Don't tell me you want to be one of them... But well, maybe you'd do better and be more sensible.
; str_npc23_kingsupport_1|You've always been just. I think you'd make a fair ruler.
; str_npc24_kingsupport_1|You've always been just. I think you'd make a fair ruler.
; str_npc25_kingsupport_1|How did you find me?
; str_npc26_kingsupport_1|I don't care.
; str_npc27_kingsupport_1|You've always been just. I think you'd make a fair ruler.
; str_npc28_kingsupport_1|You've always been just. I think you'd make a fair ruler.
; str_npc1_kingsupport_2|I surely would, {playername}. But let me tell you what might bring others to your cause -- particularly us knights. They tell us that in the old days, in the days of the Andals, those who took the throne would issue a great amnesty for all but the worst prisoners in his dungeons, release men from their vows, give people a second chance to make something of themselves -- like you gave me a second chance, {playername}.
; str_npc2_kingsupport_2|Most of the lords of this land -- well, let's just say that they never held a coin that they didn't collect as rent or take as pillage. You, on the other hand, have some experience of commerce and trade, of the effort and risk involved in making sure that men don't go hungry in Pentos while there's a glut of grain in Braavos, to give an example.... If you like, {playername}, I reckon I could find some support for you among the merchants and smallfolk of this realm.
; str_npc3_kingsupport_2|I would, my lord. But I think it would help if you announced an a great tourney once your rule is secure.
; str_npc4_kingsupport_2|Of course, {playername}. The trick is now to get others to follow you. As you know, one's lineage is a great determinant of one's worthiness. Perhaps you have a long-lost ancestor of whom you have not told me?
; str_npc5_kingsupport_2|Aye, {playername}, I would. But there is something I should say, on behalf of the men of the Reach such as myself. It would bring great joy to us, to hear from the lips of one who would be khan, that you would restore an anicent right. From the days of the old Gardener kings, the men of the Reach have enjoyed the right to bring their flocks to new pastures or to market, which necessarily involves the crossing of lands owned by the great lords of this realm.
; str_npc6_kingsupport_2|I would. I would tell anyone who listens of your deeds on behalf of the weak and helpless, of your ability to lead men against great odds and triumph, and tell them that if you were to become {king/queen}, there would be one law and one peace -- from the Dornish desert to the Braavosi coastline, from the dothraki sea to the Wall.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_2|Yes, {playername} , I would. A {king/queen}'s duty is to keep the roads safe for noble folk, make it so a maiden can gather the firewood or draw the water without being accosted by some drooling, scabby brute of an outlaw. Anyway, you've split the skulls of a number of such brutes in your time. Men would fear to even meet the eyes of a girl on the road, if you were {king/queen}.
; str_npc8_kingsupport_2|I would -- on one condition. You'd be king in Westeros or Essos or wherever you want to rule, but I'd rule my own hall. And if I had a dispute with any other of your lords, be it over land, livestock, or blood, you'd let us settle it sword to sword, according to the old ways, and let the Gods decide who is in the right.
; str_npc9_kingsupport_2|I would, {playername}, and others would too. But here's what I think -- you need to show the noble lords that you'll uphold their ancient rights. Right now, the world's a mess -- the lord owns the land, except it's the prince who owns the forest, but the city has the right to levy tax at its gates, and the commons can use the pastures on odd days, except in Qohor when it's the fifth day. Who can remember? So I say you make things simple, like it was in the days of The Freehold -- first the prince, then the lords, then everyone else.
; str_npc10_kingsupport_2|Certainly, {playername}. But I'd ask that you consider a thought of mine. If you became {king/queen}, then I'd ask you open your court to the common folks, and not just to the lords and ladies. I'd ask you to let it be known that should any man be judged and sentenced, that he have the right to appeal to you directly. Right now, the lords have the right -- I say every man in the realm should have it, too.
; str_npc11_kingsupport_2|Of course, I would! Let me see your hand, there... Aha! You've got the 'Mark of Kings.' That's what we call it in Horn Hill, anyway. I hear in Ashford it's the 'Heron's Mark' but they call everything differently, over there. Anyway, yours is very long -- I'd say that it means that you're meant to rule! It's your destiny! In fact, I think I can even recall a prophecy to that effect. Hmm, how did it go...
; str_npc12_kingsupport_2|Of course, {playername}.  But if I have learned anything in my travels in this land, it is that men are sticklers for precedent. Everything must be done as it was done in the days of old -- even though not more than one in a hundred of them can read enough to understand the chronicles! Northern merchants marry their daughters according to the 'old' rite. Westerlands cattle herders churn 'royal' butter. And of course, every king must be crowned according to 'ancient' law.
; str_npc13_kingsupport_2|Of course, {my lord/my lady}. Also, as we learn from the tale of Rand, when claiming a throne, it does not hurt to be the subject of an epic, recited around campfires and hearthfires, describing one's deeds. As you no doubt know, I fancy myself a fair crafter of couplets, though not as skilled as some.
; str_npc14_kingsupport_2|I would indeed, {playername}. I think you can unite this land, and then we'll be able to raise an army such as the world has not seen for many generations -- Pikemen, archers, heavy cavalry, and utterly crush all resistance!
; str_npc15_kingsupport_2|I would. People might say that you don't have royal blood in your veins. But as far as I've seen, royal blood makes you a skinflint. Kings and nobles will take out loans or commission building projects without half a thought to how they're ever going to pay back all those commoners who expect to eat after an honest day's work. If you ask me, an honest tongue makes a {man/woman} a {king/queen}, not a fancy pedigree.
; str_npc16_kingsupport_2|Of course, my {lord/lady}. And what's more, I figure a man like me could do you a bit of a service raising support with the lords of this land. I may have only had a small part in their schemes and intrigues over the years, but I think I know what they want. And given what I know of their secrets, they'd not want to be denying me admission to their halls, now would they?
; str_npc17_kingsupport_2|You'd do well, I'm sure of it. But is the throne really the highest power in these lands? If you want real power, you should control the food distribution. Or perhaps have the religious leaders become dependent on you. Or you could free the slaves.
; str_npc18_kingsupport_2|I would, {playername}. But when you assume the throne, you also assume the responsibility for all the women in the realm. How can you be a just king when village elders can murder innocent women? You should know that women are the bearers of all our children, so they shouldn't be mistreated.
; str_npc19_kingsupport_2|You're really serious, are you? Well, I guess you won't be too bad, so yes, I'd support you.
; str_npc20_kingsupport_2|When you keep on saying the morning prayers I taught you, I would go to hell and back for you, {playername}. I think that many people will agree with me -- a ruler who knows his faith is one worth supporting.
; str_npc21_kingsupport_2|Without a doubt, my friend. As long as you remember the children of the streets. You'll never know when there's a fallen noble among them. If you assume the throne, it would be best to see to it that all steet urchins will have a place to stay, for when your water will run out, they might otherwise come for your head.
; str_npc22_kingsupport_2|You're really serious, are you? Well, I guess you won't be too bad, so yes, I'd support you. But I can't forget what those knights did to me. Without a doubt I'm not the only one who has suffered from their wrongdoing. What can we do against them? They do as they please. Only a real king would and could punish them.
; str_npc23_kingsupport_2|You're really serious, are you? Well, I guess you won't be too bad, so yes, I'd support you.
; str_npc24_kingsupport_2|You're really serious, are you? Well, I guess you won't be too bad, so yes, I'd support you.
; str_npc25_kingsupport_2|So quiet...
; str_npc26_kingsupport_2|Fuck the kings, and fuck your ambitions.
; str_npc27_kingsupport_2|You're really serious, are you? Well, I guess you won't be too bad, so yes, I'd support you.
; str_npc28_kingsupport_2|You're really serious, are you? Well, I guess you won't be too bad, so yes, I'd support you.
; str_npc1_kingsupport_2a|Please, go on...
; str_npc2_kingsupport_2a|Please continue...
; str_npc3_kingsupport_2a|Please continue...
; str_npc4_kingsupport_2a|Of course - let me tell you all about him, {my lord/my lady}.
; str_npc5_kingsupport_2a|Please go on...
; str_npc6_kingsupport_2a|Splendid.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_2a|Well, yes, I will try to keep order...
; str_npc8_kingsupport_2a|Fair enough.
; str_npc9_kingsupport_2a|That seems sensible enough...
; str_npc10_kingsupport_2a|Of course - I would give my subjects that right.
; str_npc11_kingsupport_2a|See if you can recall that prophesy.
; str_npc12_kingsupport_2a|Interesting. Please go on...
; str_npc13_kingsupport_2a|Why, yes, that you are.
; str_npc14_kingsupport_2a|Please go on...
; str_npc15_kingsupport_2a|Well-spoken, my good man.
; str_npc16_kingsupport_2a|Interesting... Please continue.
; str_npc17_kingsupport_2a|I'll keep that in mind.
; str_npc18_kingsupport_2a|You're absolutely right. If there is any way I can help to sooth the pain of your village...
; str_npc19_kingsupport_2a|I agree, as king I could really do something about the injustice of the world.
; str_npc20_kingsupport_2a|Of course, and I'll make everyone in the realm do so too.
; str_npc21_kingsupport_2a|A noble thought, which will also raise prosperity.
; str_npc22_kingsupport_2a|I agree, as king I could really do something about that injustice among the nobility.
; str_npc23_kingsupport_2a|I agree, as king I could really do something about the injustice of the world.
; str_npc24_kingsupport_2a|I agree, as king I could really do something about the injustice of the world.
; str_npc25_kingsupport_2a|Yes, well...
; str_npc26_kingsupport_2a|Yes, well...
; str_npc27_kingsupport_2a|I agree, as king I could really do something about the injustice of the world.
; str_npc28_kingsupport_2a|I agree, as king I could really do something about the injustice of the world.
; str_npc1_kingsupport_2b|Well. We saw how that turned out...
; str_npc2_kingsupport_2b|I do not ask for their support, as they would no doubt wish to make a profit on the transaction.
; str_npc3_kingsupport_2b|I have no intention of hobbling myself in that way.
; str_npc4_kingsupport_2b|I will have no part of this, {my lord/my lady}.
; str_npc5_kingsupport_2b|I said that I wished to be {king/queen}, not that I wished to involve myself in the minutiae of the peasantry
; str_npc6_kingsupport_2b|I'm not sure that I can quite deliver all that.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_2b|I think you're maybe taking the idea of the king's peace a bit too far, there.
; str_npc8_kingsupport_2b|That's a pretty tall condition.
; str_npc9_kingsupport_2b|I'm not sure that implementing your idea would be as 'simple' as you think.
; str_npc10_kingsupport_2b|Hmm. Let me think it over.
; str_npc11_kingsupport_2b|Ah... I'll have my hand back, please.
; str_npc12_kingsupport_2b|Enough, knave. I will not have you mock our traditions.
; str_npc13_kingsupport_2b|Hmm. I'm not sure about that.
; str_npc14_kingsupport_2b|Actually, I was looking forward to a bit of rest after becoming {king/queen}...
; str_npc15_kingsupport_2b|{King/Queen} of the Clerks, maybe, Enough of such talk.
; str_npc16_kingsupport_2b|No offense, but I'm not sure that's the approach I'd take.
; str_npc17_kingsupport_2b|I'm a warrior, not a merchant. I don't want to hear anymore of this nonsense.
; str_npc18_kingsupport_2b|I can't protect all the women in the world, only the ones close to me.
; str_npc19_kingsupport_2b|I can't always be a just and fair man.
; str_npc20_kingsupport_2b|I won't be able to say them daily once I assume the throne.
; str_npc21_kingsupport_2b|If they'll try, they'll have to go through my soldiers first
; str_npc22_kingsupport_2b|You're the only one, and I can't blame all nobles for your misfortune.
; str_npc23_kingsupport_2b|I can't always be a just and fair man.
; str_npc24_kingsupport_2b|I can't always be a just and fair man.
; str_npc25_kingsupport_2b|Maybe another time...
; str_npc26_kingsupport_2b|Maybe another time...
; str_npc27_kingsupport_2b|I can't always be a just and fair man.
; str_npc28_kingsupport_2b|I can't always be a just and fair man.
; str_npc1_kingsupport_3|If I could go about this land for a few weeks, telling the common folk that you were going to amnesty their murderous kinfolk like the kings of old -- well, they would start talking of you as the rightful king, and that would pave your way to the throne. Shall I do that, {playername}?
; str_npc2_kingsupport_3|If you like, {playername}, I can take a few weeks to visit the guildhalls and manses where I have contacts, and explain to them that, in you, they will have a {king/ruler} who will check the rapacious nobles, who, with their tariffs and taxes, would strangle commerce for the sake of a few extra gold coins to spend on their roasted peacocks and ridiculous tourneys. What do you say to that {playername}?
; str_npc3_kingsupport_3|If you were to make such a pledge, {playername}, I think that it would help many of the lords of this land overcome any reluctance that they might have. Nothing brings the people and nobles together like a good tourney.
; str_npc4_kingsupport_3|Yes -- I think I have heard of that line, In fact, I can envision {his/her} entire genealogy. If you give me leave, 'Your Majesty', I shall travel about the villages and castles of this realm over the next several weeks, spreading word of your royal birth. Of course, I would hope that you would remember your faithful subject, when it comes to distributing lands...
; str_npc5_kingsupport_3|Anyway, {playername}, in these sorry times the men of the great estates have taken to blocking their passage, charging them huge fees to cross. It is a great burden on my people, {playername}. If I could take a few weeks to let the men of the Reach know that you would support the restoration of our ancient rights, well, then, I think you would find many who would support you as king, And when men speak of you as king, that's the first step to becoming one.
; str_npc6_kingsupport_3|Very well. Although I am now a stranger to my family, I have entered many a noble's hall in your train, and I reckon I would be welcome again. I shall go about this land and tell the nobles that when you are {king/queen}, you will strive your hardest to protect the weak and to crush discord, so that no man will raise his hand against another with impunity.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_3|I'll tell you what, {playername}. Give me a few weeks and I'll go to some of these villages -- stinking hovels that they are, but I reckon I can take care of myself these days. I'll tell the people there that once you unify this land, you'll wipe it clean of banditry. You'll erect gallows along the roads and keep them well-stocked with broken-necked thieves, so that every passerby knows that the wages of indecency is death.
; str_npc8_kingsupport_3|Good! Then give me a few weeks and I'll go about the courts of this land, letting it be known that you're a {king/ruler} who respects the lords and their ancient rights. You won't go sticking your royal nose where it doesn't belong, and the realm will be the better for it.
; str_npc9_kingsupport_3|It's perfectly sensible, {playername} -- and we'll be free of those cursed writs and peasants petitions and scrolls that take up all of my time and yours, when we should both be out fighting for the glory of your kingdom. Give me leave and I'll spread word among the noble lords of this land that you're here to restore the old ways, and I'll bet there will plenty who will follow you into battle.
; str_npc10_kingsupport_3|Well then, {playername}, give me leave for a few weeks and I can go about this land, letting the common folk know that you will rule justly and equitably, and that lord and common alike should be one before your law. Men will speak of you as {king/queen}, and that's a good start to becoming one...
; str_npc11_kingsupport_3|I can't recall now, but if you let me go back to my home, I could find an old greybeard who remembers it in full. And, I could put it around that you've got the mark of kings on your hand! There's many where I come from who are waiting for a just ruler, and a man's hands tell all that's worth knowing about him. Give me a few weeks, and I'll reckon I can have quite a few expecting you to be their next {king/queen}.
; str_npc12_kingsupport_3|But you know what? There was no 'old' law when it came to the crown. Sometimes one king handed the realm to his son. Sometimes his brother took the crown from the severed head of that same son. Sometimes one king murdered the last. There's no right way to crown a {king/king or queen}, and thus it makes sense that the crown should go to the one most fit to govern -- which would be you, naturally. Give me a couple of weeks, and I'll write a tract which proves it and find a copyist to post a version in every town tavern in the land. What do you say to that idea, {playername}?
; str_npc13_kingsupport_3|Then give me leave for a few weeks, and I will spin such a tale as would stir even the dullest heart, inspiring admiration for your virtues, compassion for your hardships, and indignation at those who would stand in your way. I assume, of course, that I would be able to take a certain amount of poetic license with the details?
; str_npc14_kingsupport_3|Give me leave for a few weeks, {playername}, and I will let all the worthy men of this land know that you are the one to unite not just this land, but all the world. For according to my thinking, no one should be {king/king or queen} here unless they have the capacity to rule the entirety of the world -- and you alone have demonstrated such a capacity, {playername}.
; str_npc15_kingsupport_3|I'm glad you think so. Here's what I suggest. I know men in the guilds here, men like me, who've been shafted and shaken down until they can take no more. Here's what I'll tell them -- you're honest. You respect the burghers. You'll pay your debts. You won't beggar your subjects.
; str_npc16_kingsupport_3|Give me leave for a few weeks, and I'll do a little tour of my former employers' castles. I'll sing them a pretty song about what you'll do as {king/queen}, about all the ancient freedoms you'll restore -- let them rob their tenants and tax the merchants and fight their wars and spend themselves silly without a thought to tomorrow, as a noble ought! What do you say to that, {playername}?
; str_npc17_kingsupport_3|If you give me a few weeks, I'll travel to all my old haunts to give the patrons some specific instructions. Its the perfect spots for troubadours to sing your praise. Or for the polaroid parchment painters to make pictures of your upcoming glorious rule. And if people keep resisting after that, it will still be possible to poison the food and get rid of the last opposition.
; str_npc18_kingsupport_3|I've heard that more women have escaped the grasp of my village elder. If you would dare to let me out of your sight for just a few weeks, I could seek them out and bring them the promise you've made. Word of your kindness will spread throughout the realm.
; str_npc19_kingsupport_3|Finally, {playername}, we whole hearthily agree. If you'd give me a few weeks, I could spread the story once you'll ascend to the throne, justice will spread across the land.
; str_npc20_kingsupport_3|You'd convert all of the realm to the right religion? You're even more ambitious than me. If you could give me a few weeks, I'll travel among the true believers and spread your word. Everyone will rejoice your coming, and all heathens will convert when you just ride past them.
; str_npc21_kingsupport_3|You're right: if those children are given a chance, they might make something of themselves in the world as I did. If you'd allow me to tell the homeless children of the towns what you just told me, I'm sure your standing among all people will improve.
; str_npc22_kingsupport_3|Finally, {playername}, we whole hearthily agree. If you'd give me a few weeks, I could spread the story once you'll ascend to the throne, you'll crush the nobility as the scoundrells they are. That should scare them to the bones, making it even easier for you to gain access to the highest power.
; str_npc23_kingsupport_3|Finally, {playername}, we whole hearthily agree. If you'd give me a few weeks, I could spread the story once you'll ascend to the throne, justice will spread across the land.

; str_npc25_kingsupport_3|Finally, {playername}, we whole hearthily agree. If you'd give me a few weeks, I could spread the story once you'll ascend to the throne, justice will spread across the land. FLESH, FLESH, FLESH!
; str_npc26_kingsupport_3|Guess I'l go though.
; str_npc27_kingsupport_3|Finally, {playername}, we whole hearthily agree. If you'd give me a few weeks, I could spread the story once you'll ascend to the throne, justice will spread across the land.

; str_npc1_kingsupport_objection|{playername} -- you've given leave to Maron to go tell the merchants that they will have rights over market, and forest? I can't say I like that. Give him his way, and he'll set up gibbets in every village in the land, where there will dangle some poor knight like me who thought he might pinch a young girl, in good fun.
; str_npc2_kingsupport_objection|Um, {playername}. Ser Bennis has ridden off to tell the lords of this land that you'll let them settle their quarrels by force and violence. You know they rarely actually fight each other, right? Most of the time, it's the traders and travellers on the roads between their castles that get clobbered in their petty disputes. Any excuse to shake down a caravan, they'll take. I really hope that he misunderstood you, {playername}.
; str_npc3_kingsupport_objection|{playername} -- Graznon has set off on some sort of expedition, which he says that you countenanced. He says that he will go about the villages of this land, telling the poor villagers that once you are {king/queen}, you intend to enslave your enemies. Ser, I know Graznon is an ignorant savage, but surely you would see that enslaving your opponents would only lead to chaos. There must be a place for sensibility in your kingdom.
; str_npc4_kingsupport_objection|{playername}! That filthy merchant has set off on a journey, telling the merchants that you claim the throne because you know how to balance your accounts. That's nonsense. Nobles and kings fight and rule. If they had to haggle over wages and overruns with every passing vagabond who ever did a scrap of work on their estates, then there would be nothing but disorder and chaos.
; str_npc5_kingsupport_objection|None
; str_npc6_kingsupport_objection|None.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_objection|I have heard what you told Maron, about giving every common criminal the right of appeal to the {king/ruler}. I do not approve. Bandits should be hanged when caught. Give them a trial or an appeal, and they will talk their way out of the noose. Maron is a good man, but no man can fully understand what these wolves in human form do to defenseless nobles.

; str_npc11_kingsupport_objection|None.
; str_npc12_kingsupport_objection|Captain. I hear that you've gone and made Klethi, of all people, some sort of ambassador to the aristocracy. I shudder to think of what that amoral girl might be promising them on your behalf -- and dignifying all these gross indulgences by calling them 'ancient freedoms.' By doing this, you mock those of us who who had hoped that you would have helped Calradia escape its bloody past, and move towards a new age of peace and learning. Enough, I have said my peace.
; str_npc13_kingsupport_objection|Oh valiant one -- I hear that you have given leave to Jeremus to produce some testily-worded dissertation that undermines everything the people of this land hold dear, and accuses the old emperors of murder and usurpation. Captain -- I know as a poet that people must have heroes to emulate, and a golden age to restore. Will you create a kingdom in which cynics and scholars tell us what we must believe? I can think of nothing more dull.
; str_npc14_kingsupport_objection|I understand that you've sent your man Borcha to proclaim to all Calradia that you intend to free all the miscreants of this land upon your accession to the throne. What a foul idea... Men must be governed - with whips and chains and the noose, if necessary. You'll find that out the hard way if you become {king/queen}, I'll warrant.
; str_npc15_kingsupport_objection|I understand that you've given leave to Katrin to spread some nonsense about marks on your hands. I just want to say that, as an educated man, I find it disturbing that you would resort to old women's superstitions to back your claim. Village women will believe one thing one day, another thing the next. Now a horoscope, properly cast by an astrologer at a royal university with a reputation to uphold, might tell you something worth knowing, but those have not been performed in Calradia for some time.
; str_npc16_kingsupport_objection|Oy -- Captain! I hear that Marnid's gone off to sing a pretty song to the merchants, on how you'll hand them Calradia on a silver platter for them to feast upon, smack their lips, and suck the marrow from the bones. I hope that's just a tale you're telling. A noble lord will at least toss a few coppers to the poor when he holds his feasts, and will make sure that the servants go home with full bellies. A merchant marries his daughter, and you'd be lucky to get a few crusts and scraps of gristle from the table. That's my experience, anyway.
; str_npc17_kingsupport_objection|Did I hear this right, {playername}? Did you really send Baheshtur on a mission to promise people that their income would be shut down? Forgive me if I say something strange, but doesn't the east of Calradia run its economy mainly on the toll that is paid on these mountain passes? If you really keep that promise, you'll ruin eastern Calradia. I surely hope you won't be that stupid.
; str_npc18_kingsupport_objection|My dear {sir/madame}, how could you send a murderer like Sajjad out into the lands? Have you heard how he killed all those women and children? And you want the entire nation to be like him? To be like my village elder? How could you! I thought you were a nice and decent person, not a monster like the rest of them.
; str_npc19_kingsupport_objection|...
; str_npc20_kingsupport_objection|'Games and bread'? {Sir/My lady}, did you really send Odval out into the world to say you would resort to such worldly matters once assumin the throne? I hope not, for the Heavens will strike down all these obsceneties once the End Days are nigh, and I'd hate to see you suffer for such a bad decission.
; str_npc21_kingsupport_objection|Do you really believe that Floris will let you assume the throne, my friend? I hope you didn't send him out to control everyone's food. It should be you pulling the strings, not him! I believe you've made a grave mistake there, and maybe my trust in you has been wrong, after all.
; str_npc22_kingsupport_objection|Captain, I don't mind to see bandits hang, but the way Deshavi sees it entire villages would be punished for the wrong of a few individuals. If they were nobles I could understand it, but common people like you and me? Please tell me you don't sanction her words, that you didn't mean it when you sent her on that terrible quest.

; str_npc28_kingsupport_objection|{Sir/My lady}, I don't like it that you send someone out to promote your writings. I wanted to do that.
; str_npc1_intel_mission|Well, {playername}, as it happens, I have a few cousins over in Stonehelm, and unlike some in my family, we still keep in touch. They deal in horses --- I've even been able to supply them with stock from time to time -- and so they get to pick up a bit of the gossip round the castles and great halls of the lords. I could go over there for a few days and tell you what I find out.
; str_npc2_intel_mission|{playername}! If you're interested in events in {s18}, I can still make contact with my old trading partners in {s17}. They're usually well-informed about political events.
; str_npc3_intel_mission|Captain, although I cannot return to my father's house in Oldtown, I still may make contact with my sister. She will be privy to the councils of the great merchant houses, and may tell us much about the state of the {s18}.
; str_npc4_intel_mission|{playername}, if you could spare me for a few days, I would like to look up an old friend in Lys, who has from time to time allowed me to enjoy some of his whores. He is a good man, the kind who speaks little and listens much. I'm sure over a drink or two he might let us know which way the political winds are blowing in those parts of the world.
; str_npc5_intel_mission|If you like, {playername}, I can take a few days to visit my mother's sister's uncle. He's a landed knight in the service of the Lord of Ashford. They may have some gossip about the feuds and rivalries of the great lords, if that is of interest to you.
; str_npc6_intel_mission|{playername}-- while I am not strictly welcome in my mothers household, I would be able to make contact with some tenants of an estate nearby. I hear that after I left, they did well for themselves, and they are now well-placed in society, and also less inclined than most to hold my birth against me. If you give me a few days, I may be able to collect some interesting information about the {s18}.
; str_npc7_intel_mission|{playername}. In my youth, I frequently travelled to Fairmarket with my brother Ryman, having a bit of fun in taverns, though he was always the wild one. I imagine that some of the girls, well, women now I suppose, in those taverns might remember me still, and if you'll give me permission, I can see if I can't collect some information from the town.
; str_npc8_intel_mission|If you have any interest in the events in the {s18}, a former shield-companion of mine retired and now keeps a farm near Gulltown. He keeps in contact with a number of other old warriors. I could visit him for a few days, and learn more about what is going on there.
; str_npc9_intel_mission|{playername} -- it has been some time since I sampled the delights of Myr, where gentlefolk such as myself are wont to partake of the hospitality of the most puissant and generous magister. If you wish, I could perhaps go there, and let you know something about the concerns that weigh on the minds of the great masters of {s18}.
; str_npc10_intel_mission|{playername} -- I was thinking that some of my old mates in the garrison at {s17} would be glad to see me. They are good lads, and would never betray the city, but like me they have no particular affection for the nobles that command them, and may be willing to slip a little political gossip our way. The gentry are always falling out over one little thing or the other, but the lads might be able to know if there's real dissent brewing.
; str_npc11_intel_mission|{playername} -- I was thinking that it's been a while since I visited my kinfolk in Horns Hamlet. They've been kind enough to me over the years, helping me out during the lean times, so I feel I'd like to share some of my newfound fortune with them. I've also bought wholesale enough times from the Highgarden grain merchants for them to trust me. I'd reckon they might be persuaded to spill a few tidbits about events in the {s18}, if that would interest you.
; str_npc12_intel_mission|If you wish, {playername}, I would not mind taking the time to pay a visit to a pupil of mine, now employed by the lord of {s17}. I had great hopes for him, but I have heard that he has lately endorsed the use of muskmelon for the treatment of palsy, on the grounds that its cold essence offsets an abundance of yellow bile. This is a travesty of medicine, and I must journey there swiftly to correct him. While I am there, if you wish, I could question him on the latest trends within the {s18}, a matter which may interest you.
; str_npc13_intel_mission|Oh valiant one! With your permission, I was thinking that I might pay a visit to the dales near {s17}. I try not to revisit old pastures, but I must confess a certain curiosity as to how a comely shepherdess of my former acquaintance is getting along. On the way, I may attempt to stop in at the castle. I suspect that it would not be terribly difficult for me to charm my way into the lord's hall, and I may be able to provide you with the latest news from the {s18}.
; str_npc14_intel_mission|{playername}... As you may know, I helped train the garrison of {s17}. One of their number has lately been in touch with me, and suggests that if I were to visit him, he could pass me information on events within the {s18}. I am willing to do this, if you can spare me. While it is a great disgrace to be a traitor, there is no dishonor in making use of one.
; str_npc15_intel_mission|{playername}. As you may know, I have for some time harbored a wish to go to {s17}, and study the masonry -- one of the finest examples of the old Valyrian style. As it happens, one of my colleagues is currently engaged there doing repair work on the curtain wall. While his sense of professional obligation I think would prevent him, rightfully, from disclosing to me any weaknesses in its defenses, I suspect that he would not be averse to offering up his opinion on the general state of the {s18}, if that is of interest to you.
; str_npc16_intel_mission|Oy, {playername}! I had a mind to pay a visit to my old haunts at Saltpans. Let's just say that the lord and lady of the place had commissioned a certain service from me, and had been a bit lax about payment. However, a certain sparkly bauble in the lady's possession fit the bill nicely. I see no need to trouble them by letting them know about my visit, but I could have a wee chat with my old friend the castle steward, who'll be letting me into the place, about goings-on in the {s18}.
; str_npc17_intel_mission|Maybe you've heard it by now, but the mummers in Myr is turning my diaries into a major stage performance. Of course I need to inspect it to see that they don't make too many mistakes. While I'm at it, I can peek a little around in {s17}. People tend to loosen up in the presence of a star.
; str_npc18_intel_mission|{playername}, on our travels I learned about a large group of women hiding in Lordsport. If you'd dare to let me out of your sight for just a few days, I could ask them if they have news about my village -- maybe even about the {s18}
; str_npc19_intel_mission|Ah, {playername}. I know an alchemist in Qohor. We once dissected a Lhazarene together, to learn about death. He knows much and more of {s18}, so I shall go there and learn everything he knows. Ah, I shall cry with joy once I see him again.
; str_npc20_intel_mission|{playername}, I just learned that a large part of the population of Braavos has converted to the true faith. If you could miss me for a few days, I could travel there and help them set up their foundations. And of course learn more about {s18}.
; str_npc21_intel_mission|Now that I'm a grown man, I dare to go back to Qohor and have a chat with all the people who not only helped me on my feet, but also tried to shove me deeper into the dirt. If you want, I could go back and while I'm at it, get information on the whereabouts of {s18}.
; str_npc22_intel_mission|We didn't have much where I grew up, but my teacher was a well learned man, who stayed in King's Landing when we left for the Vale. If you would allow me, I could go there and ask him some questions. We might be able to learn more about {s18} than we otherwise would.
; str_npc23_intel_mission|We didn't have much in the way of scholars in my home, but my teacher was a well learned man, who once studied at the citadel in Oldtown and later served as the maester of Barrowton. If you would allow me, I could go there and ask him some questions. We might be able to learn more about {s18} than we otherwise would.
; str_npc24_intel_mission|Back in the days of Aerys, I was well known throughout Duskendale, and every door was open to me. If I where to return, I would be greeted with opens arms by every man, woman and child!
; str_npc25_intel_mission|I left my tools in Weeping Town! Oh, and my cellar! What will happen to all the children now! RIP IT OPEN! Let me go salvage what I can, and I'll be sure to return with information! So sweet, the blood, it shines it shines, IT SHINES!
; str_npc26_intel_mission|I once knew an old mason in Tumbleton. Used to be he was gossipy as a woman. I can go visit him.
; str_npc27_intel_mission|If I visit {s17}, I bet I'll learn something about {s18}. Got a few cousins in the city, and one of them knows one of the servants inside the New Castle.
; str_npc28_intel_mission|If I visit {s17}, I bet I'll learn something about {s18}. Got a few cousins in the city, and one of them knows one of the servants inside the town keep.
; str_npc1_fief_acceptance|You'd make me lord of {s17}, {playername}? Well, that would be the kindest thing that anyone has ever done for me in a long time. Heh. I'll make the most of it, you can count on that. I have to say, though, I'm not sure how the other lords of this realm will react, when they find old Ser Bennis of Hollow Hill in their revered company. I can't say I look forward to seeing their reaction.
; str_npc2_fief_acceptance|{s17} as a fief? Well, I've always thought in terms of buying and selling goods, not in terms of governing anything. But now that you mention it, I bet I could make that place turn a fair bit of revenue. I thank you, {my lord/my lady} -- this is a very kind turn that you have done me.
; str_npc3_fief_acceptance|{My lord/My lady}, it is most generous of you to offer me {s17}. I would be pleased to hold it. Surely, a tourney would be in place, to celebrate!
; str_npc4_fief_acceptance|It is good of you to grant me {s17} as a fief, and most appropriate. Proud indeed is the sovereign who has a lord of the House of Paton as {his/her} vassal.
; str_npc5_fief_acceptance|{playername}, I would be most pleased to hold {s17}. I will send word to my family, to my kinsmen, and let them know that there is honorable gold to be earned serving under me in your armies, and they will come flocking to fight for you!
; str_npc6_fief_acceptance|{playername}! I am surprised that you find me worthy to govern men, as I am just beginning to learn to govern myself. But if you indeed wish it, I would be most honored to hold {s17} in your name, and dedicate myself to the protection of those who live there.
; str_npc7_fief_acceptance|Yes, I'll hold {s17}, and give it a reputation that strikes fear in the hearts of thieves and brigands across the world. Thank you, my liege, for this opportunity.
; str_npc8_fief_acceptance|You'd make me a lord? Well, I suppose that I can postpone going home to The Paps for a little while longer, hah! I would be pleased to raise a band of battle-hardened men to fight under your banner.
; str_npc9_fief_acceptance|{My lord/My lady}, I was cheated of my inheritance, but now, with this offer of this estate, you make right what was wrong. It would give me the greatest honor to serve you, to fight for you, and to hold this land in fief to you.
; str_npc10_fief_acceptance|You'd make me a lord? I'd put food in the bellies of the hungry, and raise a fine force of infantry to fight on your behalf, {playername}. But I can't promise that the real nobles will enjoy rubbing shoulders with me in your councils.
; str_npc11_fief_acceptance|Ay! You'd grant Garrett Longley a title of nobility? Well, I'd be daft to turn you down, now wouldn't I? My, the strange turns that life takes... Fancy this bag of bones becoming a great peer of the realm, {playername}! Just like in the stories! There's one with a young man with a destiny, and a slender blade marked with Herons. Now how did it go... It had something to do with conquering tears and being born by the dawn. And something about a crown of swords. Ah, I can't remember!
; str_npc12_fief_acceptance|Well, {my lord/my lady}, I'd have you know that don't believe in the holding of land in fief to the king. Farmers and landholders should govern their own affairs, under the distant watch of the sovereign. That being said, the world has seen far too much bloodshed for us to turn the social order on its head right now. Give me that land, and I'll endeavor to prepare it for a brighter future, if not in this generation, than perhaps in the next.
; str_npc13_fief_acceptance|How generous and kind of you, {my liege/my lady}. Allow me to express the utmost reverence for your wisdom in selecting me. Truly, your perspicacity exceeds that of King Jaehaerys, who could read the character of a man from a single hair of his head. Your judgment surpasses that of Aegon the Unlikely, to whom even the devious submitted their disputes. Anyway, I accept.
; str_npc14_fief_acceptance|You do me a great honor, {my liege/my lady}. A man such as myself has few opportunities to earn a fief of his own. But here, there is still the chance for a man to win with his sword what was denied him by his birth! I shall hold {s17} as your vassal, and raise an army to fight for your glory and for mine.
; str_npc15_fief_acceptance|Well, {my lord/my lady}, that's a gracious act, and marks you as the kind of monarch who can save this sorry land from the incompetence of the current batch. I suspect a lot of the noble lords around here will think that a commoner like me isn't fit to hold a fief. Well, when they see what I do with it, and what revenues I can bring in, they'll change their tune!
; str_npc16_fief_acceptance|Oh, that's most generous of you, {my liege/my lady}. I've been in and out of many a great hall or manor, not always with the master's permission, I should add, but I never thought I'd own one myself. Let me think... When I collect my first year's rents, what shall I buy myself? One whore, or two?
; str_npc17_fief_acceptance|I knew that it would be wise to stick around with you. I do hope that there are some really large cellars, I'll need it for all my fine wine! I thank you again, my liege, and know that your generosity will be remembered when... euhm...
; str_npc18_fief_acceptance|You want to give me {s17}? To rule there as I please? I'll turn {s17} into a female paradise, with no men around. Except for myself. Thank you so much for your trust.
; str_npc19_fief_acceptance|{playername}! The tears shall never dry on my cheeks! I shall hold {s17} and turn it into a place of learning!
; str_npc20_fief_acceptance|{playername}, I'm not worthy of such an honor, But if you really think I should be leading {s17}, I'll do my best to bring them to the right beliefs, and lead them to a golden age of obedience. And anyone who refuses shall meet my sword!
; str_npc21_fief_acceptance|Well thank you, my friend! By giving me {s17}, you put me on the track back into the higher circles. My blod will crawl back up from the dirt. You've earned my eternal gratitude by this gesture.
; str_npc22_fief_acceptance|Who would have thought that my family name, power and honor might be restored. {playername}, this really comes unexpected. I will do my best to lead {s17} in the best way possible, and to honor the simple folk like I used to be, after my house fell on hard times.
; str_npc23_fief_acceptance|Ah, who could have seen this coming. {playername}, this really comes unexpected. I will do my best to lead {s17} in the best way possible, and to honor the simple folk.
; str_npc24_fief_acceptance|Roderick the Brave, the lord of {s17}. I like it!
; str_npc25_fief_acceptance|What? Where am I?
; str_npc26_fief_acceptance|Alright, I'll be the lord of {s17}.
; str_npc27_fief_acceptance|You want to give {s17} to me? Thank you! I'll take good care of it.
; str_npc28_fief_acceptance|You want to give {s17} to me? Thank you! I'll take good care of it.
; str_npc3_woman_to_woman|My lady, if you don't mind me saying -- I think by now you have proven yourself to be one of the great warriors of this realm. Yet strangely, no king has come forward to offer you a fief. Perhaps it is because you are a woman. No matter -- I personally believe that you will take your place among the great lords of this realm, even if you have to fight twice as long and twice as hard to receive your due!
; str_npc7_woman_to_woman|Captain. If you don't mind me saying, you have fought long and hard against the scum of Calradia, and with their defeat, you make this land a better place. You are well deserving of a fief of your own -- and I suspect that if you were not a woman, a king would have offered you one by now. That is the way of the men in this sorry land: they let us stand in the front of the battleline to take the enemy's blows, but when it comes to a division of the spoils, they expect us to head to the rear.
; str_npc8_woman_to_woman|Excuse me, {playername}. I would like to offer you my congratulations -- it seems that you are well on your way to making a name for yourself as a warrior to be feared.
; str_npc11_woman_to_woman|{playername}, I just can't help thinking to myself -- you've made quite a name for yourself, haven't you? I have a feeling songs will be written of you.
; str_npc16_woman_to_woman|Oy, Captain -- if you don't mind me saying, you've made quite a name for yourself in these parts. I suspect that if you were a man, a king would have offered you a fief by now. But we ladies should come to expect things like that. Men will find any excuse not to reward us for our work, so if we take a fancy to a bit of land somewhere, maybe we should just reach out and take it. That's the way I look at the world, anyway.
; str_npc18_woman_to_woman|How harsh can this world be. Your kindness is beyond any borders, and for that alone you should be rewarded. But those pigs -- pardon me, 'men' -- rule with an iron fist and a tight rope, and have women hanged on a whim.
; str_npc19_woman_to_woman|...
; str_npc23_woman_to_woman|Oy, {playername}, if you don't mind me saying, you've made quite a name for yourself in these parts. I suspect that if you were a man, a king would have offered you a fief by now. But we ladies should come to expect things like that. Men will find any excuse not to reward us for our work, so if we take a fancy to a bit of land somewhere, maybe we should just reach out and take it. That's the way I look at the world, anyway.
; str_npc27_woman_to_woman|Come on, you can do it. If you just write enough dialogues, you might be rewarded.
; str_npc28_woman_to_woman|Come on, you can do it. If you just write enough dialogues, you might be rewarded.
; str_npc1_turn_against|I'm sorry that we meet like this, {playername}. There's no question that I owe my rise in life to you. You doubtless think me ungrateful. However, one has to follow one's destiny -- isn't that correct?
; str_npc2_turn_against|This is a sad day. I never thought that I might meet my old benefactor on the field of battle. Even if I triumph, it will bring me no joy.
; str_npc3_turn_against|Oh {playername} -- what a tragic turn our lives have taken! I can only hope that the tides of war that have made us enemies, will one day allow us to be friends.
; str_npc4_turn_against|Well.... I'm not sure what to say. If we must fight, let's get it over with.
; str_npc5_turn_against|{playername}! I took your bread and salt, and was well rewarded for it! However, I will remind you of an old truth -- that while a Reachman may be an ardent follower, and a devoted friend, he will never be your slave.... Anyway, today I come against you with my sword raised. But I hope that one day we raise a glass of Dornish Red together, to a friendship renewed.
; str_npc6_turn_against|It grieves me more than anything I can say to meet you like this, {playername}. I shall not dwell on the circumstances that have led us to this point. I can only hope that we may one day be reconciled.
; str_npc7_turn_against|Well, {playername}. You made of me a great knight, and for that I am grateful. However, you did not buy me, and now the circumstances have caused us our interests to clash, I can meet you in battle with a clear conscience. Still, I hope some day that circumstances may change again, and we may meet as friends.
; str_npc8_turn_against|So, now we meet as enemies, and may shortly face each other over the rims of our shields. A grim day this is. Sometimes, the Stranger has a dark sense of humor.
; str_npc9_turn_against|I will not accept fault for the circumstances which have led us to become enemies. I want you to know that my conscience is clear, although my heart is heavy. I have a knife with your name on it.
; str_npc10_turn_against|Well, it looks like the tides of fate have led me to make war on my old liege. Maybe things started to go wrong when you became my liege -- I suppose I was never much suited to vassalage. Anyway, here we are now. Maybe, when the world is changed and there are no more masters and servants, or lords and vassals, then we can meet together as friends.
; str_npc11_turn_against|Great heaven, {playername}. So now it looks like you and I are enemies. Didn't I say that life takes us on some very strange turns? Destiny sometimes has a cruel sense of humor -- I'll say that much. My father once described it as a wheel or a pattern or something. Something about being inexorably woven into a thread and damn us all to hell, destiny does as destiny wills.
; str_npc12_turn_against|So, it seems we must fight. I would have you know, that I have not betrayed you. I had never served you as a man, but served the principles which I believed you upheld. As you no longer uphold them, I must do my best to thwart you. But I bear you no ill will, and I hope that we can meet again some day as friends
; str_npc13_turn_against|It is sad to meet you as my enemy, {playername} -- but on the other hand, to meet such a titan of the battlefield as yourself in combat is a rare privilege. Truly, the news of our contest today shall keep the bards and poets of the world in wine and silver for months to come, do you think?
; str_npc14_turn_against|Well, {playername}. We meet as enemies. I confess that I have mixed feelings. It grieves me to make war on you, but if we meet in battle and I prevail, I will have defeated the worthiest foe in all the world, and I will know that my mastery of the military art is complete. Jini athvilajerar!
; str_npc15_turn_against|Ah... I have not been looking forward to this day. I just want to say that in my sight, if you'd kept your faith in me, things would never have come to this. But no doubt you see it differently.
; str_npc16_turn_against|Hello, {playername}! So, I guess we're enemies! One small word of warning if we end up fighting each other -- once the rage of battle hits me, I can't always account for my actions. Just know that whatever I do, it's not personal. Maybe if we both walk away from this, we can meet once more as friends?
; str_npc17_turn_against|I've been waiting for you, {playername}. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, you paid me. Now I'm the one who'll pay you a lesson, '{my lord/my lady}'.
; str_npc18_turn_against|You! I had put my trust in you. But it seems that I was misguided, for here we are, swords raised against each other. I hope that one day I can renew my trust in you, and you'll show me the same kindness you bestowed so many times upon me.
; str_npc19_turn_against|{playername}! I thought better of you. Now we face each other, and you will feel the wrath I intend to loosen upon all my enemies. But maybe... maybe one day we might discover that this has all been a big misunderstanding. I hope we will laugh at our foolishness by then.
; str_npc20_turn_against|The Heavens have diverted our paths so much that we are now standing in front of each other. Life takes strange turns, but I hope that this little quarrel won't break the bond that have formed between us, and that one day we can accompany each other again.
; str_npc21_turn_against|There you are, my friend, at the other side of my blade. I'm sorry that it has to happen like this, for our travels have bonded us beyond anything else. Maybe one day we can travel together, sharing merchandise from wherever our feet have led us. Of course, for the right price we might avoid this confrontation.
; str_npc22_turn_against|{playername}! I thought better of you. Now we face each other, and you will feel the wrath I intend to loosen upon all my enemies. But maybe... maybe one day we might discover that this has all been a big misunderstanding. I hope we will laugh at our foolishness by then.

; str_rebellion_dilemma_quarrelsome|Hmm. {s46} has never given me my due, so I don't figure I owe him much. However, maybe {s45} will be no better, and {s46} has at least shown himself .
; str_rebellion_dilemma_pitiless|Hmm. {s45} says {reg3?she:he} is the rightful heir to the throne. That is good -- it absolves me of my oath to {s46}. But still I must weight my decision carefully.

; str_feast_lengthy_description_1|The food you provided was insufficient for your guests and their retinues, forcing them to purchase their sustenance from the surrounding countryside at grossly inflated prices. The consensus among those who attended was that you failed to do your duty as a host, diminishing both their trust in you and your overall reputation.
; str_feast_lengthy_description_2|The food and drink you provided eventually ran out, forcing some guests to either buy their own from passing peddlars, or send some of their retinue home early. The more charitable attributed the shortfall to poor planning rather than meanness, but either way, it did your reputation no good.
; str_feast_lengthy_description_3|The food and drink you provided was adequate for your noble guests, although some of the commoners in their retinues went without. You are establishing a reputation as one who has at least a grasp of your social obligations as a noble.
; str_feast_lengthy_description_4|You have provided enough food and drink, and with sufficient varieties, to do yourself credit. The food, drink, and merriment have loosened your guests tongues, allowing them to converse candidly about the matters of the realm, and deepening their trust in you.
; str_feast_lengthy_description_5|You have provided a bountiful table not just for your noble guests but for their retinues, with food left over to be distributed to the poor. Your guests lavish praise upon you for your generosity, and for your understanding of the social obligations of your rank. The conversation, fueled by the food and drink, has been merry, strengthening the bonds between those who attended.
; str_feast_lengthy_description_6|The realm will be speaking of the bounty of your table for months to come, and it will become the standard to which all other feasts will aspire. You have filled the bellies not just of your noble guests and their retinues, but also of the poor who flocked to the gates.

; str_quick_battle_troop_1|There is a reason no one goes about the cities without armed guards once the sun sets, and that reason is Rodrigo de Braganca. Once a bright eyed merchant who arrived at Tihr with a small fortune in rubies and a dream to corner the velvet market, he was soon reduced to a pauper, having lost everything to cutthroat competition with the colluding Rhodok merchant guilds. But he soon turned measuring scales into swords, and applied his considerable business smarts into building up the deadliest criminal enterprise in Veluca, with hideouts and operations in every major town. He has attained his goal, for the price on his head is greater than the riches he once pursued. Now he takes great pleasure in relieving his former competitors of their worldly goods -— and worries.
; str_quick_battle_troop_2|Usiatra usurped leadership of the group of bandits that occupied Siri, a rural village in the southern deserts outside the realm of Calradia, in a curt and bloody fashion when she was seventeen years old. Under her direction, the band of ruffians quickly expanded their operations across the southlands. Her shrewd, decisive manner, combined with her merciless ambition which she acts upon with inhuman composure and cruelty, garners fanatic admiration from those that follow her. As such, amongst her own she lives a decadent, spoilt lifestyle -- built upon the violent plundering she exacts in her travels. Her military strength and natural strategic wit allowed her outfit to remain undealt with in her homeland, and now she turns her eye towards the rich lands of Calradia to sustain her war band.
; str_quick_battle_troop_3|The second son of a minor noble living near Uxkhal, Hegen was educated in the art of war and single combat. After being knighted he served as a paid knight in the army of the lord of Uxkhal and fought against the Vaegirs before leading a group of outriders that defeated a Khergit raid near Amere. The ensuing counter raid and the following two campaigns earned him glory and fame as a warrior. Unfortunately, he lost any chance of further prestige when peace was declared and he was discharged. With no hope of inheriting and his skills at war languishing in peace, he assembled other young warriors and set out as a mercenary captain. He now hopes to take advantage of the fact that Calradia never lacks warring states in need of mercenaries.
; str_quick_battle_troop_4|Konrad is a professional mercenary from the distant land of Balion, far beyond the vast western ocean. Having spent most of his years on campaign and seen countless battles, Konrad has grown to love his life as a soldier of fortune. Though he once had his nose flattened by a mace blow and has received many wounds, he has nevertheless survived this harsh existence through the strength of his arm, innate cunning and pure luck. Hearing of the lucrative career opportunities awaiting a man of his talents in Calradia, Konrad chartered a vessel and crossed the sea with his men in search of new wars to fight in. A sellsword with no ties to any of the Calradian states, he is more than happy to offer his services to any lord with a fat enough coin-purse.
; str_quick_battle_troop_5|Sverre is one of the so-called sea raiders -- freebooters and lawless men from the icy realm of Jumne beyond the North Sea, also said to be the ancestral home of the Nords. Already as a young man he has been along on many raids against both his distant cousins in the Wercheg region and the Vaegirs. However, Sverre was always a sharp lad, and it didn't take him long to see that Calradia was a far more prosperous land than his own, and that he could have a better life here than among his own people. During a raid on Jayek, Sverre stole away while his comrades were busy looting the village and taking captives. Passing himself off as a yokel from the Chalbek mountains, Sverre quickly built up a reputation for himself as a fierce fighter, and he now seeks his fortune at the head of a mercenary band.
; str_quick_battle_troop_6|Hailing from Charnye, in the far reaches of the Vaegir tundra, Borislav is a hunter. For all of his life he has tracked the beasts of the wild for their meat and fur, living off the land just as his forefathers had done in happier days, before the endless wars. Now, the game is quick to take fright from the constant sounds of battle, and the wanton slaughter of animals by soldiers has left empty those forests that have not been burnt down. Facing starvation, Borislav chose to turn his great skill with bow and spear, learned from hunting stag, wolf, and bear, to the practice of hunting men, and his steady hand and keen eye have claimed many lives. Borislav does not care much for the disputes of kingdoms, and is only really interested in keeping himself and his men fed.
; str_quick_battle_troop_7|Stavros was born in the independent city-state of Zendar, and spent much of his adult life serving in the town watch under the famous constable Hareck. Stavros' leadership and prowess were instrumental in ridding the area of the dreaded river pirates, but even he was powerless against the calamity that befell the city. When Zendar was razed to the ground by a great horde of sea raiders, Stavros fled the burning city in a crowd of refugees. After a brief period of wandering and odd jobs, he found a place in a mercenary company, eventually rising to become its leader due to his dedication and tactical aptitude. He now devotes most of his efforts to working with manhunters and local authorities against the sea raiders and other outlaws, trying to keep the land safe for travelers.
; str_quick_battle_troop_8|Growing up with one of the nomadic tribes deep in the desert beyond Sarranid lands, Gamara learned early on how to hunt with sling and spear. However, the simple life and pitiless conditions in the desert did not satisfy her, and she burned with a desire to see the great world beyond that she had heard so many wondrous tales about. Life is not easy for an adventuring young woman, and Gamara had to learn the ways of Calradia quickly. Taking the weapons and armor of a soldier who had attacked her after a dispute, Gamara now hides her beauty under thick Sarranid garb, and many never even suspect she is a woman –- certainly as a force on the battlefield she is as dangerous as any man. She has gathered about her a group of followers, and together they wander the war-torn land in search of glory.
; str_quick_battle_troop_9|Aethrod is not a noble person. He's changed his name twice, and is blamed for most of the crimes on Vaegir territory. True or not, he claims to never have taken an innocent man's life, and considers himself a patriotic citizen, several times bringing his band or renegades to the assistance of his faction, when it is threatened. In times of peace, however, most lords must be careful when he is in the vicinity due to his daring personality and willingness to challenge a lord. Born and rasied in the slums of Reyvadin, he learned how to use a bow at an early age and ran away from home a fourteen. Now at thirty two, his archery skills are near perfect and though he can't ride a horse well, he can hit one at the furthest of distances. Tough as nails and sharp as a hawk, he is a true local legend.
; str_quick_battle_troop_10|Being the daughter of one of the most infamous bandit leaders in the Sarranid realm isn't always easy, but Zaira seems to have managed quite well. Unlike most women she grew up learning the ways of the desert warrior and is deadly with the sword as well as the bow. While the other girls her age learned how to manage the household, Zaira learned how to best gut a merchant before taking his money. At the age of sixteen Zaira had killed more men than the average veteran in the Sultan's army. Just before her twentieth brithday her father was killed in brawl with another bandit leader. As the only child, Zaira now took control of her father's band. After avenging her father, she quickly picked up where he had left. Now she's on a good way of establishing her own reputation has a bandit leader.
; str_quick_battle_troop_11|Argo Sendnar had quite a diversified life. When he arrived at Calradia, working as a trader, he hoped for more income than in Lokti. Little did he know, that the wartorn Calradia was a wasps' nest for bandits and cutthroats that made trading a lot more complicated than in Lokti. Being bought out by another competeting trader, after losing all his goods and money due to caravan raids, he was forced to serve as a caravan guard to make a living. Despite his pathetic fighting skills, he soon found an employment on one of the more dangerous routes through Calradia. Due to sheer luck he managed to stay alive long enough to aquire enough combat experience and money to start his own buisness as a caravan master, offering his services to traders in need of defense for their goods.

; str_you_need_more_men_sir_my_lady|Look -- you need more men. Right now, you have only {reg0} in your party. If you attack them with too few men, you may find their hideout by getting yourself dragged up to it in fetters, and that's not the plan. Do not take that risk. Go out and visit some more villages to find more volunteers, and then you can start paying them back in their own coin.
; str_good_you_have_enough_men|Good, good. You did well. You have enough men. Now, go and knock some of those robbers over the head, and make them tell you how to find their hideout.
; str_do_not_waste_time_go_and_learn_where_my_brother_is|Look. Time is at a bit of premium, here. Now, if you could go find out where they are hiding my brother, that would be appreciated.

; str_reason_2|An attack on {s8} poses a greater danger to our realm.

; str_are_you_all_right|Now... let me explain my proposition.
; str_you_are_awake|Ah -- you're awake. It's good to see that you can still walk. You're lucky that we came along. I had been speaking with the castle guards, when we heard the sounds of a fight and ran to see what was happening. We didn't arrive in time to prevent you getting knocked down, but we may have saved you from getting your throat cut... Now... Maybe you can help me...
; str_save_town_from_bandits|Save {s9} from bandits.
; str_you_fought_well_at_town_fight_survived|Hah! Well done {playername} -- I saw at least three of the enemy go down before you. Keep fighting like that, and you'll make quite a name for yourself here in the Stormlands. 
; str_you_fought_normal_at_town_fight_survived|Well done {playername}! I hear you accounted for one or two of the bastards, and you're still on your feet. You can't ask for a better outcome of a battle than that...
; str_you_fought_bad_at_town_fight_survived|Well, {playername}, the enemy is in flight, and it looks like you're still on your feet. At the end of the day, that's all that's important in a battle.
; str_you_fought_well_at_town_fight|Ah! You're awake {playername}. You took quite a blow, there. But good news! We defeated them -- and you did them some real damage before you went down. If you hadn't been here, it could have gone very baldy. I'm grateful to you...
; str_you_wounded_at_town_fight|Ah! You're alive {playername}. That's a relief. You took quite a blow, there. I'm not sure that you got any of them yourself, but thankfully, the rest of us were able to beat them. We'll need to see about getting you some treatment....

; str_you_fought_well_at_town_fight_answer|Ah well. I guess I don't mind a blow taken in a good cause.
; str_you_wounded_at_town_fight_answer|Right. I suppose I should be more careful.

; str_unfortunately_reg0_civilians_wounded_during_fight| Unfortunately, one of my lads took a pretty nasty blow. I should go see how he is doing.
; str_also_one_another_good_news_is_any_civilians_did_not_wounded_during_fight| Also, no one on our side was hurt very seriously. That's good news
; str_merchant_and_you_call_some_townsmen_and_guards_to_get_ready_and_you_get_out_from_tavern|You leave the tavern and go out to the streets. Nervous looking young men are waiting in every street corner. You can see they have daggers and clubs concealed under their clothes, and catch a mixture of fear, anticipation and pride in the quick looks they throw at you as you pass by. Praying that your enemies have not been alarmed by this all too obvious bunch of plotters, you check your weapons for one last time and prepare yourself for the action ahead.
; str_town_fight_ended_you_and_citizens_cleaned_town_from_bandits|The remaining few bandits scatter off to the town's narrow alleys, only to be hunted down one by one by the angry townsfolk. Making sure that your victory is complete and all the wounded have been taken care of, you and the merchant head to his house to review the day's events.
; str_town_fight_ended_you_and_citizens_cleaned_town_from_bandits_you_wounded|You fall down with that last blow, unable to move and trying hard not to pass out. Soon the sounds of fighting filling the street gives way to the cheers of the townsmen and you realize with relief that your side won the day. Soon, friendly arms pick you up from the ground and you let yourself drift off to a blissful sleep. Hours later, you wake up in the merchants house.
; str_journey_to_reyvadin|You have come through the Vaegir highlands, a plateau exposed to the bitter winds from the north. The land here is frozen for most of the year, but the forests are rich with fur-bearing game, and the rivers are teaming with fish. The riches of the land draw the traders, but the traders in turn draw bandits. You saw the occasional dark figure mounted on a shaggy pony, watching the passage of your caravan from a snowy ridge, and were glad when the spires of Reyvadin came into view across the wide valley of the Boluk river.
; str_journey_to_praven|You join a merchant and his family, travelling towards Storm's End. Green shoots of wheat, barley and oats are all across the dark soil of the rolling hills, and on the lower slopes of the snowcapped mountains, herds of cattle, aurochs and sheep are grazing on the summer grass. Occasionally, too, you catch sight of one of the great war horses that are the pride of the nobility. The land here is rich -- but also troubled, as the occasional burnt-out farm bears witness, a testament to the chaos the Tyrell host caused when it marched through sixteen years earlier. You keep a wide berth of the forests, where desperate men have taken refuge. While passing by the burned ruins of Summerhall, the merchant declares that he's changed his mind, wanting to take his wares to Weeping Tower instead, having heard of Lyseni galleys docking at the nearby harbor.
; str_journey_to_jelkala|You came by ship, skirting the cliffs where the Rhodok highlands meet the sea. Much of the coastline was obscured by tendrils of fog that snaked down the river valleys, but occasionally you caught sight of a castle watchtower rising above the mists -- and on one occasion, a beacon fire burning to warn of an enemy warband. You knew that you were relatively safe at sea, as you were too far south to risk encountering the sea raiders who trouble the coasts of the Nordic lands, but it was still a relief to reach the Selver estuary, gateway to the port of Jelkala, and see a Rhodok galley riding at anchor, its pennants fluttering in the evening breeze.
; str_journey_to_sargoth|You took passage with a trading longship, carrying gyrfalcons from the furthest reaches of the north to be bartered for linen and wool. It sailed early in the season, but the master reckoned that the risks of drifting ice and later winter storms could be justified by arriving ahead of the Sea Raiders, who by April would be sailing forth from their island lairs to ravage Calradia's coasts. It was some relief when your ship came in sight of the delta of the Vyl and Boluk rivers, and a short while later, rowed past tidal flats and coastal marshes to the city of Sargoth, home to the Sea Raiders' distant kinsmen, the Nordic lords, who a few generations ago had carved themselves a kingdom in this rich but troubled land.
; str_journey_to_tulga|You came with a caravan, crossing the mountains that border Calradia on the north and east, bringing spices from faraway lands to trade for wool and salt. The passes were still choked with snow, and it was hard going, but at last you crested a ridge and saw before you the Calradian steppes. On some hillsides the thin grass of spring was already turning yellow, but the lower slopes of the mountains were still a vibrant green. Herds of sheep and tawny steppe ponies drifted across them like clouds, testifying to the wealth of the Khergit khans. From time to time small groups of horsemen would follow your caravan from a distance, perhaps sizing up how well you could defend the wealth you carried, so it was with some relief that you saw the towers of Tulga rising up from the plains.
; str_journey_to_shariz|You came with a caravan, crossing the great desert to the east of Calradia. The bedouin guides chose your route carefully, leapfrogging through treacherous dune fields and across empty gravel plains to low-lying oases rich with orchards and date palms. Your great fear was that the caravan might lose its way and perish of thirst. The small bands of raiders who hovered just out of bowshot, waiting to pick off stragglers, were oddly a comfort -- at least water could be no more than a day's ride away. It was a great relief when the mountains came into view, and on the evening of the following day you crested a rocky pass and in the distance could make out the sea, and the towers of Shariz silhouetted against the sunset.
; str_lost_tavern_duel_ordinary|You slump to the floor, stunned by the drunk's last blow. Your attacker's rage immediately seems to slacken. He drops into a chair and sits there watching you, muttering under his breath, almost regretfully. A few of the other patrons manage to coax him to his feet and bundle him out the door. One of the others attends to your wounds, and soon you too are back on your feet, unsteady but alive.
; str_lost_tavern_duel_assassin|You slump to the floor, stunned by your attacker's last blow. Slowly and deliberately, he kneels down by your side, pulling a long knife from under his clothes. But before he can finish you off, the tavernkeeper, who seems to have regained his courage, comes up from behind and gives your attacker a clout behind the head. He loses his balance, and then, seeing that his chance to kill you has been lost, makes a dash for the door. He gets away. Meanwhile, the other tavern patrons bind your wounds and haul you to a back room to rest and recover.
; str_lost_startup_hideout_attack|You recover consciousness a short while later, and see that the kidnappers have celebrated their victory by breaking open a cask of wine, and have forgotten to take a few elementary precautions -- like binding your hands and feet. You manage to slip away. Based on the boisterous sounds coming from the hideout, you suspect that you may yet have some time to gather a few more followers and launch another attack.
