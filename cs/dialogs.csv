dlga_start:close_window.2|Snažím se tu něco zahrát.
dlga_award_fief_to_vassal:award_fief_to_vassal_defer|Přeji si odložit jmenování lorda, než se o tom poradím.
dlga_award_fief_to_vassal_defer:close_window|Jak si přeješ, {můj pane/má paní}. Můžeš to rozhodnout později

dlga_start:fighter_talk|Zdravím. Vybrušujeme si tu své bojové schopnosti s trochou sparing tréninku. Vypadáš, že by se ti nějaký trénink hodil. Přidej se k nám a my ti ukážeme pár triků. A pokud potřebuješ vysvětlit cokoliv ohledně soubojů, prostě se mě zeptej a pokusím se ti to co nejlépe vysvětlit.
dlga_start:fighter_talk.1|Co si chceš procvičit?
dlga_fighter_pretalk:fighter_talk|Řekni mi co za cvičení chceš.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_attack|Chci si procvičit výpady.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_parry|Chci si procvičit obranu se zbraní.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_combat|Pojďme na sparing.
dlga_fighter_talk:close_window|[Opustit]
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack:fighter_talk_train_attack_2|Dobrá tedy. Jsou zde čtyři různé směry útoků. Jsou jimi horní, pravý a levý švih a bodnutí. Teď ti řeknu z kterého směru máš zaútočit a ty se pokusíš o ten správný útok. ^^(Pohni myší zatímco držíš levé tlačítko pro zvolení směru útoku. Například pro horní švih pohni myší nahoru ve chvíli kdy stiskneš levé tlačítko. Ikonky na obrazovce ti pomohou provést správný úder.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:close_window|Tak začněme. Jsem připraven.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:fighter_pretalk|Vlastně bych raději dělal něco jiného.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry:fighter_talk_train_parry_2|Narozdíl od štítu, obrana zbraní může zastavit útok přicházející pouze z jednoho směru. Například pokud se blokuješ shora, odrazíš pouze horní švih. Stále můžeš být zasažen z boku nebo bodnutím. ^^(Pro blokování musíš stisknout a podržet pravé tlačítko.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_2:fighter_talk_train_parry_3|Teď budu útočit z různých směrů a chci abys je všechny zablokoval. Snaž se provést správný blok co nejrychleji. ^^(Toto cvičení je lehké s nastavením 'automatického blokování', které je v základu zapnuté. Pokud vstoupíš do nastavení a změníš směr obrany na určen klávesnicí, nebo myší, budeš muset vybírat směr ručně. To je mnohem náročnější, ale hra bude o to více zajímavá. V takovém případě může být toto cvičení velmi nápomocné.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:close_window|Tak začněme. Jsem připraven.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:fighter_pretalk|Vlastně bych raději dělal něco jiného.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat:fighter_talk_train_combat_2|Sparing je výborný způsob přípravy pro skutečný boj. Budeme bojovat proti sobě nesmrtícími zbraněmi, dokud jede z nás nespadne na zem. Samozřejmě můžeš získat nějaké ty modřiny, ale pořád lepší, než se nechat pořezat skutečnou zbraní.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:close_window|Tak začněme. Jsem připraven.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:fighter_pretalk|Vlastně bych raději dělal něco jiného.
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again|Dobře. Byl si schopný blokovat mé útoky. Můžeš si toto cvičení zopakovat a zkusit to pokaždé o něco rychleji, dokud si svou obranou nebudeš jistý. Chceš to zkusit znovu?
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again.1|No to nešlo moc dobře, že? (Pamatuj, musíš stisknout a podržet pravé tlačítko myši, aby blok fungoval.) Chceš tomu dát ještě šanci?
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_train_parry|Ano, zkusme to znovu.
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_parry|Ne, díky. Myslím, že mi to stačilo.
dlga_start:fighter_parry_warn|Hej! Děláme obranné cvičení {kámo/děvče}! Máš se bránit mým útokům, ne mi je vracet.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_train_parry|Promiň, zkusme to znovu.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_leave_parry|Promiň, musím tohle cvičení nechat.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_parry:close_window|Dobrá, jak chceš.
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again|No, to nešlo moc dobře, že? Nebuď kvůli tomu naštvan{ý/á} a zkus se příště vyvarovat těm samým chybám. Chceš to zkusit znovu?
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_train_combat|Ano, dám si ještě jedno kolo.
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_combat|Ne, tohle mi už stačilo.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_combat:close_window|No dobrá, řekni pokud si to rozmyslíš.
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again.1|Hej, to byl dobrý sparing. Porazi{l/la} jsi mě, ale příště si dám větší pozor. Chceš to zkusit znovu?
dlga_start:fighter_talk.2|Velmi dobře. Naučil ses jak zaútočit odkud chceš. Pokud chceš můžeme si to zkusit znovu, nebo se přesunem k dalšímu cvičení.
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2|To nebylo zlé. Zdá se, že jsi pochytil základy lukostřelby. Teď zkus to samé, ale s kuší. Vezmi si tu kuši a šipky co jsou támhle a tref se to těch třech terčů. S kuší je mnohem snazší střílet oproti luku, ale potřebuješ ji přebít po každém výstřelu.
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2.1|Dobře, neměl jsi moc problémů ani s kuší. Další na řadě jsou vrhací zbraně. Vezmi si oštěpy co jsou támhle a tref ty tři terče.
dlga_start:ranged_end|Nuže, získal jsi základní schopnosti ovládání všech tří typů střelných zbraní. Zbytek přijde s cvikem. Trénuj každý den a za čas budeš dobrý jako nejlepší střelci v Calradii.
dlga_ranged_end:close_window|Teď si můžeš jít promluvit s cvičiteli boje zblízka, nebo jezdectví, pokud jsi to ještě neudělal. Mohou tě také naučit důležité schopnosti.
dlga_start:archer_talk|Zdravím tě, mládenče. Trávím čas vyučováním zacházení se střelnými zbraněmi každého, kdo má zájem. Pokud chceš učitele, dej mi vědět a naučím tě jak používat luk, kuši a oštěpy.
dlga_archer_talk:archer_challenge|Ano, nauč mě používat zbraně na dálku.
dlga_archer_talk:close_window|Ne, teď ne.
dlga_archer_challenge:archer_challenge_2|Dobrá. Tvůj první trénink bude v lukostřelbě. Luk je náročná zbraň na ovládnutí, ale jakmile se v tom jednou staneš dobrým, můžeš střílet rychle a s velkou silou. Běž si sebrat ten luk a šípy co tu vidíš a tref se do těch terčů.
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window|Dobře, jsem přípraven.
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window.1|Minutku, chci nejprve něco udělat.
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2|Doufám, že sis užil jízdu. Teď zkusíme něco náročnějšího. Vezmi si to kopí a jeď znovu a tref všechny terče.
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2.1|Dobře! Trefil si všechny terče ze hřbetu koně. To pro začátek není snadné. Další výzva bude s použitím luku. Miř na ty střelecké terče cestou. Pro zvládnutí musíš trefit každý z nich.
dlga_start:horsemanship_end|Velmi dobře. Trefil si je všechny i ze hřbetu koně. Pokračuj v cvičení jezdectví každý den a brzy budeš zkušeným jezdcem.
dlga_horsemanship_end:close_window|Teď si můžeš jít promluvit s cvičitelem boje z blízka nebo střelby, pokud jsi to ještě neudělal. Musíš se naučit všechno co můžeš, abys byl připraven se bránit.
dlga_start:horseman_talk|Dobrý den. Přišel jsem se procvičit v jezdectví, ale bolí mě kosti a raději si dnes odpočinu. Pokud chceš můžeš si půjčit mou klisnu a procvičit se. Trocha pohybu ji udělá dobře.
dlga_horseman_talk:horseman_challenge|Ano, to bych moc rád.
dlga_horseman_talk:close_window|Uhm, možná později.
dlga_horseman_challenge:horseman_melee_challenge_2|Dobře. Teď ti dám pár cviků, ve kterých se naučíš používat zbraně ze hřbetu koně. Tvůj první úkol je jednoduchý. Nasedni na koně a projeď se tu. Jakkoliv pomalu, nebo rychle chceš, a až si budeš  v sedle jistý vrať se a dám ti pár náročnějších cvičení.
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window|Dobře, jsem přípraven.
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window.1|Minutku, chci nejprve něco udělat.
dlga_tutorial_troop_default:close_window|Hej, snažím se tu cvičit. Běž si promluvit s cvičitelem střelby pokud potřebuješ.
dlga_start:lord_prison_break_confirm_3|Je snad změna plánu?
dlga_start:lord_prison_break|Co se děje?
dlga_start:drunk_response|Na co to tak civíš?
dlga_start:drunk_response.1|To civíš na mě?
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window|Taková škoda...
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window.1|Raději on, než-li já.
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start|Nejsem si jistý... nějaké zvíře očividně.
dlga_drunk_response:dplmc_drunk_attempt_placate|Pardon, přijměte mou omluvu, prosím
dlga_dplmc_drunk_attempt_placate:close_window|Nechám to plavat... pro tentokrát. Teď odprejskni.
dlga_dplmc_drunk_attempt_placate:close_window.1|Smažu ti ten škleb z tváře.
dlga_drunk_fight_start:close_window|Smažu ti ten škleb z tváře.
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_player_high_renown|Máš představu o tom kdo jsem?
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start|Má mě to zajímat?
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start.1|Velká slova od zakrslíka. Srovnám tě, kam patříš.
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_player_high_renown|Emmm... Vlastně... Ano, ano, vím kdo jste, {s0}. Prosím odpustě mi, {Vaše milosti/Má paní}. Musím být opilí, hned odcházím.
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start.2|Proč, když chceš boj, máš ho mít!
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:close_window|Myslel jsem si to. Teď se odkliď.
dlga_start:fistfight_response|Vypadáš jako {chlap/žena} co snese pár tvrdých ran a taky je umí vrátit. Mám pro tebe zajímavou nabídku pokud máš zájem.
dlga_fistfight_response:fistfight_response_2|Jakou?
dlga_fistfight_response_2:fistfight_response_2a|Dobře, jsem rád, že máš zájem. Tady je můj plán, je to trochu komplikované, takže poslouchej pozorně.
dlga_fistfight_response_2a:fistfight_response_3|Ty a tenhle chlap tu začnete boj, žádné zbraně, žádné brnění. Já to budu sledovat zpovzdálí a brát sázky. Pokud vyhraješ, zisk si rozdělíme. Pokud budeme tratit tak to celé zaplatím. Nemáš co ztratit, tedy kromě trochy krve, samozřejmě.
dlga_fistfight_response_3:fistfight_response_4|Každopádně to nemůžeme udělat jako v aréně, kde si každý přijde vsadit před zápasem. Lidí vejdou dovnitř, podívat se co je to tu za rozruch a budou si chtít vsadit na toho, kdo podle nich zrovna vyhrává. Dám na vás rovný kurz, jinak by to bylo moc složité na někoho, kdo už pije svůj třetí džbán piva.
dlga_fistfight_response_4:fistfight_response_4a|Takže trik je v tom protáhnout ten souboj co nejdéle, tak aby to vypadalo, že prohráváš a lidé si vsadí proti tobě. Pak se vzchopíš a vyhraješ, než si začnou vsázet na tebe. Nejlepší bude, pokud se necháš téměř srazit na zem a nakonec se vzchopíš a složíš toho chlapa. Musí to však být až na samotném konci, abychom si něco vydělali. 
dlga_fistfight_response_4a:fistfight_response_5|Také však nemůžeš ten souboj protahovat příliš dlouho, nebo lidé začnou být podezíraví, takže každou chvíli musí aspoň jeden z vás dostat pořádnou ránu. Je mi jedno čí krev bude prolita, ale něčí téct musí.
dlga_fistfight_response_5:fistfight_response_5a|A ještě jedna věc, příteli, tvůj soupeř... není moc vynalézavý. Půjdou po tobě přímo, takže je na tobě abys {zahrál/zahrála} správně to divadlo.
dlga_fistfight_response_5a:fistfight_response_confirm|Takže, co myslíš?
dlga_fistfight_response_confirm:close_window.1|Mám lepší věci na práci.
dlga_start:ramun_introduce_1|Přeji Vám hezký den, {mládenče/děvče}.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:ramun_introduce_2|Odpusťte mi, vypadáte jako obchodník, ale nevidím žádné Vaše zboží.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:close_window|Nevadí.
dlga_ramun_introduce_2:ramun_introduce_3|Obchodník? Ale ano, to rozhodně jsem. Ale moje zboží se od ostatním trochu liší. Musí být nakrmeno a napito dvakrát denně a snaží se utéct, když se otočím.
dlga_ramun_introduce_3:ramun_introduce_4|Hospodářská zvířata?
dlga_ramun_introduce_4:ramun_introduce_5|Vcelku blízko. Jsem člověk, který drží každou loď na moři v pohybu. Lodě jsou poháněny vesly, jak víš, a vesla potřebují muže, kteří je tahají. A tam přicházím já.
dlga_ramun_introduce_5:ramun_introduce_6|Lodní otroci.
dlga_ramun_introduce_6:ramun_introduce_7|Teď jste to trefil! Obchodní přístav jako tento by bez nich nemohl přežít. Lodě ztratí pár rukou pokaždé, když vyplují, takže je vždy vysoká poptávka. Kapitáni chodí ke mě a platí dobře.
dlga_ramun_introduce_7:ramun_introduce_8|Odkud ti otroci pocházejí?
dlga_ramun_introduce_8:ramun_introduce_9|Většinou to jsou odsouzení kriminálníci, které odkupuji od správců. Jiní jsou vězni z války, různých národností, kteří jsou přivedeni ke mě, protože nabízím nejlepší ceny. každopádně příležitostně kupuji i od lupičů a jiných 'individuí'. Nemůžeš být vybíravý pokud jde o dodavatele v tomto oboru. Náhodou sebou nemáš nějaké vězně, že?
dlga_ramun_introduce_9:ramun_introduce_10|Já?
dlga_ramun_introduce_10:ramun_introduce_11|Proč ne? Pokud odejdeš z města, dříve či později s někým zkřížíš meče. A když dá Bůh, zvítězíš. Proč si na tom také trochu nepřivydělat? Přiveď je živé zpátky ke mně a zaplatím ti 50 zlatých za každého z nich. Kdo byli nebo odkud pochází mě nezajímá.
dlga_ramun_introduce_11:ramun_introduce_12|Hmm. Popřemýšlím o tom.
dlga_ramun_introduce_12:close_window|To rozhodně udělej! Je zde spousta možností k výdělku pro nás pro oba.
dlga_start:ramun_talk|Zdravím, {playername}.
dlga_ramun_pre_talk:ramun_talk|Ještě něco?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners|Přivedl jsem ti nějaké vězně, Ramune. Chceš se podívat?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners_all|Chci prodat všechny vězně co tu se sebou mám.
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all:ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2|Vezmu si tvých {reg0} {reg2?věznů:vězně} za {reg1} zlaťáků. Platí?
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Platí.
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2:ramun_pre_talk|Nech mě si to rozmyslet.
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Podívám se co tu máš...
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|Potěšení s tebou obchodovat.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing|Jak někoho zajmu?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing.1|Můžeš mi znovu povědět o zajímání vězňů?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_have_blunt_weapon|Jsi v tomhle {nový/nová} že? Vysvětlím ti to co nejjednodušeji. Základem pro zajmutí nepřátel je používat tupé zbraně, jako jsou palice, kyje nebo palcáty místo sekaní ostrým mečem. Takhle se na chvíli prospí místo toho, aby vykrváceli k smrti, chápeš? Předpokládám, že nějakou tupou zbraň máš...
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Samozřejmě.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no|Ve skutečnosti, ne.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Dobrá, pak tedy vše co musíš udělat, je ty prevíty tou zbraní umlátit do bezvědomí, a až bude po boji tak ho vsadíš do řetězů. Trochu jiné je to s lordy a šlechtici. Bývají tak dobře chránění, že nezáleží na tom jakou zbraň použiješ, ale obyčejní vojáci budou krvácet, jak zapíchnuté prase, pokud proti nim použiješ něco ostrého. Nemám moc velké nároky na své zboží, ale musejí dýchat, když je kupuji.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2|Ne? Heh, tak to musí být tvůj šťastný den. Mám tu se sebou jednu starou palici, kterou jsem stejně chtěl vyhodit. je trochu otlučená, ale stále se sní dá někdo srazit k zemi. Tady, vezmi si ji.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Díky Ramune. Možná si to s ní vyzkouším.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Dobrá, zkusím ti to vysvětlit znovu. Základem pro zajmutí nepřátel je používat tupé zbraně, jako jsou palice, kyje nebo palcáty místo sekaní ostrým mečem. Trochu jiné je to s lordy a šlechtici. Bývají tak dobře chránění, že nezáleží na tom jakou zbraň použiješ, ale obyčejní vojáci budou krvácet, jak zapíchnuté prase, pokud proti nim použiješ něco ostrého.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_2:ramun_ask_about_capturing_3|No, teď už tomu snad rozumíš. Ještě něco?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_3:ramun_ask_about_capturing_4|No, není to tak jednoduché jak se to zdá. Tupé zbraně nezpůsobí tolik škody jako ostré, takže s nimi nevyhraješ tak snadno. A věř mi, mít sebemenší příležitost, většina těch mizerů by tě zabila hned na potkání, takže od nich nečekej žádné slitování, ani když vytáhneš palici místo meče. Kromě toho tím, že se sebou budeš vláčet vězně tě zpomalí, což je i důvod proč je mnozí propustí hned po bitvě. Je to šílenství. Jak může někdo jen tak pustit tolik zlata, eh?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_4:ramun_ask_about_capturing_5|Je to všechno?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_5:ramun_ask_about_capturing_7|Už jen poslední věc. Starat se o vězně není snadné, můžeš to nazvat dovedností, pokud chceš. Jestli chceš zajmou mnoho vězňů, {měl/měla} by ses o tom něco přiučit, nebo se nepostaráš o jediného může co chytíš.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_7:ramun_pre_talk|Díky, budu si to pamatovat.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_leave|Raději už půjdu.
dlga_ramun_leave:close_window|Pamatuj, jakéhokoliv vězně co budeš mít přiveď ke mě. Za každého z nich ti zaplatím zlatem.
dlga_start:close_window.5|Pokorně žádám aby {vaše lordstvo držel/milostivá paní držela} ruce tak, abych na ně viděl.
dlga_start:manhunter_talk_b|Hej, ty tam! {Neviděl/Neviděla} jsi tu v okolí nějaké psance?
dlga_manhunter_talk_b:manhunter_talk_b1|Ano, prošli tu asi před hodinou.

dlga_start:merchant_quest_2a|Skvělá práce. {Najal/Najala} jsi dost mužů, aby se vypořádali s bandity. Teď... pocestní z {s9} mi řekli, že je tu skupina zlodějů, čekajících před městem.

dlga_merchant_quest_4b:merchant_quest_4b1|Možná. o potřebuješ?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b1:merchant_quest_4b2|Pamatuješ si jak jsem ti říkal, že ti bandité mají někoho uvnitř? Myslím, že vím kdo to je. Je to kapitán stráží, bohužel. Před pár měsíci tenhle kapitán viděl kolik naše obchody vynáší, tak se rozhodl půjčit si nějaké peníze a investovat do karavany. Bohužel si, stejně jako mnozí začátečníci, neuvědomil, že s velkým ziskem přichází i velký risk. Investoval všechny peníze do nejdražších komodit a ta karavana byla samozřejmě napadena a okradena. On přišel o všechno.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b2:merchant_quest_4b3|Kvůli tomu se náš kapitán rozhodl přejít k darebáctví, aby si vykompenzoval své štěstí. Asi bych se zachoval stejně, kdybych se při Sedmi zadlužil a ztroskotal. Teď si každý kapitán platí několik zlodějů, kteří o informují o těch ostatních, ale tenhle kapitán si je rozhodl se s nimi domluvit v plném rozsahu. Přivede je do města, nechá je dělat co se jim zlíbí a pak si od nich bere podíl z kořisti. Slyšel jsi už, že se pytlík stal hajným? No, v tomhle nešťastném světě, se občas hajný stane pytlákem. Naštěstí je zde stále několik statečných a čestným mužů z hlídky, kteří mi řekli jak to tu chodí.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b3:merchant_quest_4b4|Teď... tady je můj plán. Mohl bych to přednést {s4}, ale to by jen znamenalo vyšetřování. Mé slovo proti kapitánovu a svědci mohou být podplaceni a důkazy zničeny. Nebo bude celá záležitost zapomenuta, kdyby zrovna nepřítel překročil naše hranice a já bych za ty potíže dostal akorát tak nůž do zad. V časech války se oči {s0} upírají daleko od {reg4?jejího:jeho} sídla a občané trpí. Takže mám jiný nápad. Dám dohromady malou skupinou měšťanů z mých lidí, nebo těch, kteří již rukou banditů trpěli a vrazíme do kapitánova domu a v řetězech ho předvedeme před {s4} a doufám, že i s několika zajatými bandity, kteří to budou moci vše vysvětlit.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b4:merchant_quest_4b5|Vše co potřebuji je někdo, kdo by je mohl vést do bitvy a nenapadá mě nikdo lepší než ty. Takže, co na to říkáš?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b5:merchant_quest_4b6|Jak můžu vědět, že mi říkáš pravdu?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b6:merchant_quest_4b7|Oh, no, je možné, že jsem našel tucet banditů, kteří by položili život, aby procházejícímu cizinci dali falešný dojem života ve starém {s4} (Lepé jsem to nepřeložil)... Hádám, že si nemůžeš být {jistý/jistá}, jestli mluvím pravdu, ale určitě už víš, že je mé zlato je pravé a mám tu dalších 100 kusů, nebo možná trochu víc, které čekají, až pro mne uděláš tuhle poslední laskavost. Takže co říkáš?

Alespoň tolik milosti jsem dostal... ale je slabým vládcem, protože ti slabý staví na první místo svou autoritu, a až na druhé spravedlnost. Nejspíš bych v {reg4?její:jeho} kůži udělal totéž.

; dlga_immobile_lord2:lord_pretalk.4|The women of Dorne do not share the sentiments of the other families of Westeros, and as the head of House Toland, I have to take an active hand in handling the affairs of the realm and my domains.
; dlga_lord_talk:immobile_lord.8|My lady, you should not ride into war like this.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.1|Hah! Our little plot against {s3} worked perfectly, {playername}. The fool has lost one of {reg0?her:his} most valuable retainers, and we are one step closer to bringing {reg0?her:him} to {reg0?his:her} knees. Here, this purse contains 800 coins, and I wish you to have it. You deserve every copper. And, need I remind you, there could be much more to come if you've a mind to earn it...
; dlga_lord_start:close_window|You werent't able to complete a simple task. I had set up everything. The only thing you needed to do was sacrifice a messenger, and we would be celebrating now. But no, you were too damned honorable, weren't you?
; dlga_lord_start:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed|Have you brought me any news about that task I gave you? You know the one I mean...
; dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2|I have the reports you wanted right here.
; dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2:lord_pretalk|Ahh, well done. It's good to have competent {men/people} on my side. Here is the payment I promised you.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk|Brilliant work, {playername}! Whatever you did, the nobles of the {s13} are clamoring for war! Soon, the time will come for us to reap the benefits of our hard work, from fields ripe for plunder. This war is going to make us rich, mark my words!
; dlga_lord_start:lord_collect_debt_completed|I'm told that you've collected the money owed me from {s7}. Good, it's past time I had it back. I believe I promised to give you one-fifth of it all, eh? Well, that makes {reg3} coins, so if you give me my share -- that's {reg4} coins -- you can keep the rest.
; dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_pay|Of course, {s65}. {reg4} coins, all here.
; dlga_lord_collect_debt_pay:lord_pretalk|I must admit I'm impressed, {playername}. I had lost hope of ever getting this money back. Please accept my sincere thanks.
; dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_no_pay|I am afraid I don't have the money with me, my lord.
; dlga_lord_collect_debt_no_pay:close_window|Is this a joke? I know full well that {s7} gave you the money, and I want every coin owed to me. As far as I'm concerned, I hold you personally in my debt until I see that silver.
; dlga_lord_start:close_window.1|I heard you got rid of that poxy merchant that was causing me so much grief. I can see you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh? I like that in a {man/woman}. Here's your reward. Remember, {playername}, stick with me and we'll go a long, long way together.
; dlga_lord_start:close_window.2|Oh, it's you. Enlighten me, how exactly does one lose a simple fight to some poxy, lowborn merchant? Truly, if I ever need my guardsmen to take a lesson in how to lay down and die, I'll be sure to come to you. Just leave me be, {playername}, I have things to do.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go|You! Do you have sawdust between your ears? Did you think that when I said to kill the merchant, I meant you to have a nice chat with him and then let him go?! What possessed you?
; dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2|My lord, I made sure he will not act against you.
; dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2:lord_pretalk|Piffle. You were supposed to remove him, not give him a sermon and send him on his way. He had better do as you say, or you'll both regret it. Here, this is half the money I promised you. Don't say a word, {playername}, you're lucky to get even that. I have little use for {men/women} who cannot follow orders.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_completed|Beautiful work, {playername}! You captured both the spy and {reg0?her:his} handler, just as I'd hoped, and the pair are now safely ensconced in my dungeon, waiting to be questioned. My torturer shall be busy tonight! Anyway, I'm very pleased with your success, {playername}, and I give you this purse as a token of my appreciation.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you! I wanted TWO prisoners, {playername} -- what you've brought me is one step short of useless! I already know everything the spy knows, it was the handler I was after. Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|I asked you for two prisoners, {playername}, not one. Two. Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler, the more important one of the pair. The spy will not dare return here and will prove quite useless to whatever master {reg0?she:he} served. 'Tis better than nothing. However, you'll understand if I pay you half the promised reward for what is but half a success.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you are nothing short of totally incompetent. Failing to capture both the spy AND {reg0?her:his} handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure. Forget any reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it.
; dlga_lord_follow_spy_half_completed:lord_pretalk|I did my best, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_follow_spy_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_follow_spy_failed:lord_pretalk|Hrm. As you like, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.2|Splendid work, {playername}. All the serfs are back, properly cowed, and they're busy preparing for the harvest. You certainly earned your reward. Here, take it, with my compliments.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed|{playername}. I have been waiting patiently for my serfs, yet none have returned. Have you an explanation? Were you outwitted by simple fieldhands, or are you merely incompetent? Or perhaps you are plotting with my enemies, intending to ruin me...
; dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a|Forgive me, {s65}, those serfs were slippery as eels.
; dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b|Perhaps if you had treated them better...
; dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Hmph, that is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I need to recruit new men to work these fields before we all starve.
; dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b:close_window|Hah, now you reveal your true colours, traitor! Your words match your actions all too well. I should never have trusted you.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were 3 groups of serfs that I charged you to return. 3. Not {reg17}. I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away. As for your reward, {playername}, I'll only pay you for the serfs you returned, not the ones you let fly. Here. Take it, and let this business be done.
; dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}. You are indeed generous.
; dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Bah, this proved to be a waste of my time.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_deal_with_bandits_completed|{playername}, I was told that you have crushed the bandits at my village of {s5}. Please know that I am most grateful to you for that. Please, let me pay the expenses of your campaign. Here, I hope these {reg14} coins will be adequate.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk|Not a problem, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.2|It was mere child's play.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.1|Damn it, {playername}. I heard that you were unable to drive off the bandits from my village of {s5}, and thanks to you, my village now lies in ruins. Everyone said that you were a capable warrior, but appearently, they were wrong.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank|Ah, {playername}. My quartermaster has informed me of your delivery, {reg13} heads of cattle, as I requested. I'm impressed.

; dlga_lord_start:lord_scout_waypoints_thank|You make a good scout, {playername}. My runner just brought me your reports of the mission to {s13}, {s14} and {s15}. Well done.
; dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk|A simple task, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Nothing I couldn't handle.
; dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.2|My pleasure, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army|The army's supplies are dwindling too quickly, {playername}. I need you to bring me {reg3} heads of cattle so I can keep the troops fed. I care very little about where you get them, just bring them to me as soon as you can.
; dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted|Very well, your grace, I can find some cattle for you.
; dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected|Sorry, your grace, I have other plans.
; dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted:close_window|Excellent! You know what to do, {playername}, now get to it. I need that cattle sooner rather than later.
; dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected:close_window|That . . . is unfortunate, {playername}. I shall have to find someone else who's up to the task. Please go now, I've work to do.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.2|Thank you for answering the summons, {playername}. However, as we are now at peace, we do not need your services. You may attend to your other business.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_report_to_army_asked|Ah, you have arrived at last, {playername}. We've been expecting you. I hope you have brought with you troops of sufficient number and experience.
; dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_completed|I have a company of good, hardened soldiers with me. We are ready to join you.
; dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_continue|I don't have the sufficient number of troops yet. I will need some more time.
; dlga_lord_report_to_army_completed:close_window|Excellent. We'll be moving soon. Now -- you are a {man/warrior} of sound judgement, and we trust that you will do what is necessary to support our campaign. I do not require you to remain close at hand, and I will not count it against you if you believe that your forces would be of better use elsewhere. But if you do choose to remain with me, to support me in battle, that would be appreciated. I may also have additional tasks for you to perform.
; dlga_lord_report_to_army_continue:close_window|Then you'd better hurry. We'll be moving out soon against the enemy and I need every able hand we can muster.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints|{playername}, I need a volunteer to scout the area. We're sorely lacking on information, and I simply must have a better picture of the situation before we can proceed. I want you to go to {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and report back whatever you find.
; dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted|You've found your volunteer, my lord.
; dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected|I fear I must decline, your grace.
; dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted:close_window|Good {man/lass}! Simply pass near {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and check out what's there. Make a note of anything you find and return to me as soon as possible.
; dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected:lord_pretalk|Hm. I'm disappointed, {playername}. Very disappointed. We'll talk later, I need to go and find somebody to scout for us.
; dlga_lord_generic_mission_thank:lord_generic_mission_completed|You have been most helpful, {playername}. My thanks.
; dlga_lord_generic_mission_completed:lord_pretalk|It was an honour to serve, my lord.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_pay_debt_2|I think you owe me {reg1} coins, {playername}. Do you intend to pay your debt anytime soon?

You can wait for {reg0?her:his} family to pay {reg0?her:his} ransom of course, but there is no telling how long that will take, eh?

; dlga_lord_truce_offer:close_window|I accept. Let us stop making war upon each other, for the time being anyway
; dlga_lord_truce_offer:lord_pretalk|On second thought, such an accord would not be in my interests.
; dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2|Hmm. I could use my considerable influence to arrange a pardon for you, {playername}, but there are some who see you as an enemy and will not be satisfied unless you pay tribute. All in all, you'd need to bring no less than {reg16} coins to make any friends in {s4}.
; dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.4|I am in no position to offer you anything. You must speak to {s7}.
; dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2.1|Yes... I have bigger worries than you or your followers. However, you have wronged my subjects, and wrongs demand compensation. For the sum of {reg16} coins, I suppose that I could agree to grant you a pardon. What do you say?
; dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.5|I am sorry. I am in no position to offer you a pardon
; dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept|I have the money here. {reg16} coins.
; dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny|I fear I cannot pay that much.
; dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window|Excellent, {playername}. I will use this to make amends to those you have wronged, and I will let it be known that you are no longer an enemy of the {s4}.
; dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window.1|Excellent, {playername}. I'll use the coin to smooth the feathers of those that can oppose your pardon, and I'm sure that word will soon spread that you are no longer an enemy of {s4}.
; dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny:lord_pretalk|Then there's nothing I can do for you, {playername}. No silver, no pardon.
; dlga_lord_talk:lord_active_mission_1|About the task you gave me...
; dlga_lord_talk:lord_switch_to_spouse|Let us discuss matters related to our household.
; dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:lord_pretalk|Let us wait until we are in a hall, {s0}, as it is difficult to deal with household inventories and such matters in the field.
; dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:spouse_talk|Certainly, {s0}
; dlga_lord_talk:lord_request_mission_ask|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_lord_talk:wildfire_talk2|Do you own a valyrian dagger?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3|I do, I do. A fine thing, quite exquisite. Forged in the fires of the Freehold, you know. I own quite a collection actually.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4|Can I convince you to let me buy one of them?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5|I suppose that could be arranged. I shall require 10000 coins for one of my daggers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk|Very well. Here is the gold.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk.1|I can't afford that.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.1|Of course I do. I am a triarch of Volantis, of the blood of Old Valyria. We are the heirs to the Dragonlords, and house Vhassar is the most noble of all the families who live within the Black Walls. We have several artifacts from the Freehold, daggers, ingots of steel, weapons of great importance.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.1|I suppose that could be arranged. The elections are almost upon us, and the people should be mollified by games and feasts, that they may know my great power. But alas, such spectacle is not cheap. I shall require 15000 coins for one of my daggers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk.2|I can't afford that.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.2|What noble in Volantis does not? We where the closest allies of the Freehold, the first daughter of Old Valyria. Amongst the families living within the Black Walls, valyrian daggers are as plentiful as the dates upon a palm tree. I use one as a paper weight, hah!
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.2|Bah! Like a common merchant? Who do you think I am? I am of the blood of the dragons! How dare you! No, I cannot sell you a dagger. But ah, what kind of man would I be if I was not generous! You can have a dagger from me, on one condition. Bring me a bottle of Tyroshi Pear Brandy. I have a thirst, and nothing quenches it like a large goblet of brandy. Say what you will of the tyroshi, but they know how to make liquor.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk.3|Very well. Here is the brandy.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk.4|I will return with a bottle of brandy.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.3|Ah, yes. A fine blade. I own quite a few. They make for very good gifts, especially when one looks to obtain favorable winds for ones fleet. I myself favor Bakkalon, but I've heard that Gomon Eldros sacrificed one to Boash, the Blind God! Can you imagine that?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.3|I suppose that could be arranged. Daggers are not good for much, you know. I don't need one to cut my meat, an ordinary one suffices for that, and what else can one do with it? I shall require 5000 coins for one of my daggers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:lord_pretalk.5|I can't afford that.
; dlga_lord_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2|I've cleared out the pirates on Bloodstone.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3|Well, I'm glad they have been taken care of. Those islands are usually teeming with outlaws, but it haven't been too bad lately.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk4|I imagine their death might be worth a reward.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk4:pj_wildfire_talk5|Reckon so, do you?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6|I suppose the people of Tyrosh could find some way to thank you for your services. Here, take this.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:pj_wildfire_talk7|Thank you.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk7:lord_pretalk|My pleasure. Less pirates means more trade.
; dlga_lord_talk:wildfire_talk2.1|My lord, what will you do about Renly?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.4|Renly... What has Renly ever done to earn a throne? He sits in council and jests with Littlefinger, and at tourneys he dons his splendid suit of armor and allows himself to be knocked off his horse by a better man. That is the sum of my brother Renly, who wants to be king. It is not a question of wanting.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk5|The throne is mine, as Robert's heir. That is law. After me, it must pass to my daughter, unless Selyse should finally give me a son. I am king. Wants do not enter into it. I have a duty to my daughter. To the realm. Even to Robert. He loved me but little, I know, yet he was my brother. The Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him. She may have murdered him as well, as she murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark. For such crimes there must be justice. I mean to scour King's Landing clean, to bring justice to lord and peasant alike, and for that I must sit the Iron Throne.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6|How can I be of service, my lord?
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7|How indeed, {playername}? Renly is my younger brother. By law the throne belongs to me. By all the laws of gods and men. He intends to flaunt these laws, and for that there must be justice.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8|I, Stannis Baratheon, King of Westeros, hereby charge you with bringing justice to Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End. I denounce him, and attaint him, I strip him of all rank and title, of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death. Do your duty, {playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:wildfire_talk9|The kinslayer is accursed in the eyes of the gods, your Grace.
; dlga_wildfire_talk9:wildfire_talk10|I stopped believing in gods the day I saw the Windproud break up across the bay. Any gods so monstrous as to drown my mother and father would never have my worship, I vowed. In King’s Landing, the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the Seven, but all I ever saw of either was made by men. Men make justice, and it is all a king must do.
; dlga_wildfire_talk10:lord_pretalk|I never asked for this crown. Gold is cold and heavy on the head, but so long as I am the king, I have a duty. I shall bring justice to Westeros, a thing Renly understands as little as war. The lords must pay the traitors price, and when I come into my kingdom, they shall. Every man shall reap what he has sown, from the highest lord to the lowest gutter rat. And some will lose more than the tips off their fingers, I promise you. They have made my kingdom bleed, and I do not forget that.
; dlga_lord_talk:wildfire_talk2.2|Lord Renly is dead.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.5|Renly... The Iron Throne is mine by rights. All those who deny it are my foes. Yet Renly was my brother. I did not like the man he grew to be, but I remember him as a boy... If he had done his duty by me, I would sit the throne now, and he would be my chosen heir.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:lord_pretalk|Those lords who supported him, however... Good men and true will fight for Joffrey, wrongly believing him the true king. A northman might even say the same of Robb Stark. But these lords who flocked to my brother’s banners knew him for a usurper. They turned their backs on their rightful king for no better reason than dreams of power and glory, and I have marked them for what they are.
; dlga_lord_talk:combined_political_quests|Do you think we can work together to advance our standings in this realm?
; dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk|I do not imagine that you and I have many mutual interests.
; dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk.1|Hmm.. Perhaps we can discuss this matter in a more private setting, at a later date.
; dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk.2|Hmm.. I do have an idea, but it would require you that you be free of controversy. If you were to wait some time without getting into any arguments with the other {s0} of our realm, perhaps we could proceed further.
; dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_resign_marshalship|I wish to resign the marshalship
; dlga_lord_ask_resign_marshalship:lord_pretalk|So be it. I shall have to find someone else.
; dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service|{s66}, I have come to offer you my sword in vassalage!

Normally, honorable nobles will grant prisoners of gentle blood the privilege of parole, and treat them as honored guests so long as they give their word that they will not attempt to escape, until such time as a ransom can be paid.  But {s14}, instead of granting {s13} parole, has consigned my {s11} to {reg3?her:his} dungeons -- no doubt in the hope that {reg3?she:he} can demand more from us.

You may be able to pay a ransom -- in which case we could cover your expenses, up to 5000 coins. If you have connections within {s24}, you may be able to use them to sneak {reg4?her:him} out. Or, you may try a more direct approach -- walk up to the gaoler, take the keys by force, and then fight your way out. Can you do this for us?
; dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_accepted|I can try.
; dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_rejected|I don't think that I can help you.

; dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak_2|I had discussed this idea with some of my men. One could enter {s24}, either in disguise or openly, then walk up to the prison guard and try to take the keys by force. However, getting out may be difficult. The garrison may be slow to react, but even so, you are likely to find yourself fighting a half dozen or more of the enemy at once, with limited space in which to maneuver. If you can fight your way past them, though, you can probably get out.
; dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak_2:lord_mission_rescue_other_ideas|You may find it useful to create a distraction, to divert the attention of some of the garrison. If you have any connections in the villages near {s24}, this may be a time to put them to use.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war|This peace with {s13} ill suits me, {playername}. We've let those swine have their way for far too long. Now they get stronger with each passing and their arrogance knows no bounds. I say, we must wage war on them before it's too late! Unfortunately, some of the bleeding hearts among our realm's lords are blocking a possible declaration of war. Witless cowards with no stomach for blood.
; dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_2|You are right, {s65}, but what can we do?
; dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_1|I disagree, my lord. It is better that there be peace.
; dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_2:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3|Ah, 'tis good to hear someone who understands! As a matter of fact, there is something we can do, {playername}. A little bit of provocation... If one of our war parties managed to enter their territory and pillage one of their caravans, or raided one of their villages, and perhaps left behind a little token or two of the {s14}, they would have ample cause to declare war on us. And then, well, even the cowards among us must rise to defend themselves. So what do you say? Are you interested?
; dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|An excellent plan. Count me in.
; dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_4|Why don't you do that yourself?
; dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_4:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5|Well, {playername}, some of the lords in our sovereignty won't like the idea of someone inciting a war without their consent. They are already looking for an excuse to get at me, and if I did this they could make me pay for it dearly. You, on the other hand, are young and well-liked and daring, so you might just get away with it. And of course I will back you up and defend your actions against your opponents. All in all, a few lords might be upset at your endeavour, but I am sure you won't be bothered with that.
; dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|That seems reasonable. I am willing to do this.
; dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_2|I don't like this. Find yourself someone else to take the blame for your schemes.
; dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted:close_window|Very good! A raid on a caravan, or, if you can't manage that, an attack on one of their villages, should do the trick. Now, good luck and good hunting. Go set the borders aflame!

; dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_2:lord_pretalk|Hm. As you wish, {playername}. I thought you had some fire in you, but it seems I was wrong.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|Well, some of the serfs working my fields in {s4} have run away. The ungrateful swine, I let them plough my fields and rent my cottages, and this is how they repay me! From what I've been hearing, they're running to {s3} as fast as they can, and have split up into three groups to try and avoid capture. I want you to capture all three groups and fetch them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary.

He should be seized and hanged for his impudence, but we also believe that very soon he will leave town to meet with his master, the man to whom the spy feeds all his little whispers.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2|I want you to wait here until the spy leaves town. Then you must follow him, stealthily, to the meeting place.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted:close_window|Good, I'm sure you'll do a fine job of it. One of my men will point the spy out to you when he leaves, so you will know the man to follow. Remember, I want them both, and I want them alive.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero|There is a difficult job I need done, {playername}, and you may be the {man/one} who can carry it off. I need someone to capture one of the noble lords of {s13} and bring him to me. Afterwards, I'll be able to exchange him in return for a relative of mine held by {s13}.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt|Some time ago, I loaned out a considerable sum of money to {s3}. {reg4} coins, to be precise. {reg0?She:He} was supposed to pay it back within a month but I haven't received a copper from {reg0?her:him} since. That was months ago. If you could collect the debt from {reg0?her:him} on my behalf, I would be grateful indeed. I would even let you keep one fifth of the money for your trouble. What do you say?

; dlga_start:lady_escort_lady_succeeded|Thank you for escorting me here, {playername}. Please accept this gift as a token of my gratitude. I hope we shall meet again sometime in the future.
; dlga_lady_escort_lady_succeeded:close_window|It was an honor to serve you, {s65}.
; dlga_start:lady_start.2|Ah {playername} - you must have received my message. How happy I am that you could come!
; dlga_start:lady_proposal_pending|{playername} - is there any word from my family?
; dlga_start:lady_betrothed|I hear that my {s11} has refused your request to marry me. Does that mean that we must part?
; dlga_start:lady_generic_mission_succeeded|Oh, {playername}, you brought {reg4?her:him} back to me! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.

; dlga_start:lady_meet_end|You must be {playername}. We have just had the honor of watching you distinguish yourself in the recent melee{s8}.
; dlga_start:lady_meet_end.1|You must be {playername}. My {s15} {s16} has spoken most highly of you. I am delighted to make your acquaintance.
; dlga_start:lady_premeet|I say, you don't look familiar...
; dlga_start:close_window.25|Ah, {playername}. How good it is to see you again. However, I believe that I am required elsewhere.
; dlga_start:lady_start.3|{playername} -- how good it is to see you. (Whispers:) I still remember your visits fondly.
; dlga_start:lady_meet_end.2|Ah, {playername}. How spendid it was to see you distinguish yourself in the recent tourney.
; dlga_start:lady_start.4|{s12}
; dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed|I have sad news. I have become betrothed to {s5} -- against my will, I should say! Oh {playername} - I would so much rather be wed to you!
; dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed.1|Good {playername} -- I have become betrothed to {s5}. It is now no longer seemly for us to see each other like this.
; dlga_lady_start:lady_other_suitor|I must tell you -- there is another lord who has been paying me attentions, although I cannot abide {reg0?her:him}. I fear {reg0?she:he} has designs on me, and may try to force me to wed against my will.
; dlga_lady_start:lady_talk|{s11}It is probably not suitable for us to tarry too long here in conversation, but I would hope to see you again soon.

; dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.2|Ah {playername}, although you are kind to me, I am not certain enough of your moral fiber to risk such a thing.

; dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.3|Good {playername} -- to elope would be to throw away my ties with my family, which are everything to me! I have a considerable affection for you, but I am not sure that I am prepared to risk that.
; dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.4|Good {playername} -- I am not used to the hardships of campaigning as you are. I want a home to call my own. If you were lord of a castle or town with a great hall, I would gladly go there as your {reg0?wife:husband}, to be {reg0?mistress:keeper} of the household. But I do not wish to live like a hunted animal.
; dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_elope_agree|Elope with you? Yes -- we could do that. It is a great step to defy my family -- but a loveless marriage, and life without you, might be a far worse thing!

; dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_yes:close_window|Farewell, {playername}. We will see each other, in the courts and castles of this realm, but we must keep our distance from each other. I will remember these days fondly, nonetheless.

; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4|Very well, you may keep your post for the time being.

; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_4:siege_won_seneschal_5|Thank you, my {lord/lady}. If you do not mind my impudence, may I inquire as to what you wish to do with the castle?
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6|I will sell it to another lord.
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6.1|I intend to claim it for myself.
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_list_options|I haven't given it much thought. What are my options?
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2|According to our laws and traditions, you can do one of several things. First, you could station a garrison here to protect the castle from any immediate counterattacks, then request an audience with some wealthy lord and ask him to make you an offer. It would be worth a tidy sum, believe you me. If you do not wish to sell, then you will have to find yourself a liege lord and protector who would accept homage from you. Without a royal investiture and an army at your back, you would have a difficult time holding on to the castle. Both you and {s1} would become great big targets for any man with a few soldiers and a scrap of ambition. 
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3|What do you mean, a liege lord and protector? I won this place by my own hand, I don't need anyone else!
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4|Of course you don't, my {lord/lady}. However, no lord in the land will recognize your claim to the castle unless it is verified by royal decree. They would call {s1} an outlaw stronghold and take it from you at the earliest opportunity. Surely not even you could stand against a whole army.
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4:siege_won_seneschal_6|Hmm. I'll give it some thought.
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_6:close_window|I am very pleased to hear it, my {lord/lady}. I am only trying to serve you to the best of my ability. Now, if at any time you find you have further need of me, I will be in the great hall arranging a smooth handover of the castle to your forces. 
; dlga_start:seneschal_intro_1|Good day. I do not believe I've seen you here before. Let me extend my welcome to you as the seneschal of {s1}.

; dlga_seneschal_intro_1a:seneschal_talk|How can I help you?
; dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1b|What exactly do you do here?
; dlga_seneschal_intro_1b:seneschal_talk|Ah, a seneschal's duties are many, good {my lord/woman}. For example, I collect the rents from my lord's estates, I manage the castle's storerooms, I deal with the local peasantry, I take care of castle staff, I arrange supplies for the garrison... All mundane matters on this fief are my responsibility, on behalf of my lord. Everything except commanding the soldiers themselves.

; dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_lost|I was told to deliver you {reg9} units of {s4}, but I lost the cargo on the way.
; dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_lost:tavernkeeper_pretalk|What? I was waiting for that {s4} for weeks! And now you are telling me that you lost it? You may rest assured that I will let {s1} know about this.

; dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result_2:close_window|I'll keep my ears open for other opportunities. You may want to ask again from time to time.
; dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:close_window|I guess I should leave now.
; dlga_start:ransom_broker_intro|Greetings to you, {s0}. You look like someone who should get to know me.
; dlga_ransom_broker_intro:ransom_broker_intro_2|Why is that?
; dlga_ransom_broker_intro_2:ransom_broker_info_talk|I broker ransoms for the poor wretches who are captured in these endless wars. Normally I travel between the salt mines and the slave markets on the coast, on commission from those whose relatives have gone missing. But if I'm out on my errands of mercy, and I come across a fellow dragging around a captive or two, well, there's no harm in a little speculative investment, is there? And you look like the type who might have a prisoner to sell.
; dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_families|What if their families can't pay?
; dlga_ransom_broker_families:ransom_broker_info_talk|Oh, then I spin them a few heartwarming tales of life on the galleys. You'd be surprised what sorts of treasures a peasant can dig out of his cowshed or wheedle out of his cousins, assuming he's got the proper motivation! And if in the end they cannot come up with the silver, then there are always slave merchants who are looking for galley slaves. One cannot do the Gods work with an empty purse, you see.
; dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_prices|What can I get for a prisoner?
; dlga_ransom_broker_prices:ransom_broker_info_talk|It varies. I fancy that I have a fine eye for assessing a ransom. There are a dozen little things about a man that will tell you whether he goes to bed hungry, or dines each night on soft dumplings and goose. The real money of course is in the gentry, and if you ever want to do my job you'll want to learn about every landowning family in the known world, their estates, their heraldry, their offspring both lawful and bastard, and, of course, their credit with the merchants.
; dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_me|Would you be able to ransom me if I were taken?
; dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_me:ransom_broker_info_talk|Of course. I'm welcome in every court. There's not many who can say that! So always be sure to keep a pot of coins buried somewhere, and a loyal servant who can find it in a hurry.
; dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thank you.
; dlga_start:ransom_broker_talk|Greetings. If you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
; dlga_ransom_broker_pretalk:ransom_broker_talk|Anyway, if you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
; dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners|Then you'd better bring your purse. I have got prisoners to sell.
; dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all|I want to sell all the prisoners I have with me.
; dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all_2|Let's see...  I'll give you {reg0} coins for your {reg1} {reg2?prisoners:prisoner}.  Do we have a deal?

; dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_accept:ransom_broker_talk|Splendid! In a few days, I would think, you should find {s5} riding to rejoin you, blinking in the sunlight and no doubt very grateful! Is there any other way in which I can help you?
; dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_refuse:ransom_broker_talk|Of course, of course... Never mind what they say about the rats, by the way -- I've never actually seen one myself, on account of the pitch-black darkness.

; dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk|Greetings, friend. You look like the kind of {man/person} who'd do well to know me. I travel a lot all across all the world and keep an open ear. I can provide you information that you might find useful. For a meager price of course.

; dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk.1|Thanks, but I don't really care.
; dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk.1|Greetings, {playername}.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_pretalk:tavern_traveler_talk|Yes?
; dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms|What can you tell me about this land?
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2|The Free cities of Essos have been trying to eliminate each other since the Bleeding Years, more than three hundred years ago. Until recently, Westeros was ruled by a single king, but with Robert Baratheons death, the seven kingdoms have fragmented, with both his brothers and his son claiming the throne, and Robb Stark fighting for independence. I hear that the Dothraki have been causing trouble in the east, but I seldom travel that far, and either way, the Demon Road, the Ruins of Valyria and the Dothraki Sea make the journey dangerous. Only fools travel that way! Anyhow, at least the current chaos, gripping the world, must present an adventurer such as yourself with quite the opportunities. With some luck and skill, you can make a name for yourself here, amass a fortune perhaps, or gain great power. Opportunities are endless and so are the rewards, if you are willing to risk your life for them.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3|Tell me more about these opportunities.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:close_window|Thank you. That was all I needed to know.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Well, you probably know everything I could tell you already. You seem to be doing pretty well.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a|The archons, kings, princes and lords will pay good money for sellswords if they are engaged in a war. If you have done a bit of fighting, speaking with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a sellsword contract. However the real rewards come if you can manage to become a vassal to a king or a lord. A vassal can own villages, castles and towns and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these estates. Normally, only nobles of the realm own land in this way, but in time of war, a king will not hesitate to accept someone who distinguishes {himself/herself} on the battlefield as a vassal, and grant {him/her} the right to own land.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|It is not unheard-of for adventurers to renounce allegiance to king altogether, declare themselves kings, and claim land in their own name. This is a difficult path, however, as the great nobles of the land, with their long ancestries, are not likely to accept such upstarts as their liege. Such rulers would need to be very careful in establishing their right to rule, or they would be set upon from all sides.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5|It might be easier for an adventurer like yourself to pledge support to an existing king's rival.  There are many such pretenders in the world -- those who are born to the right family, who go around and stir up trouble saying they have a better claim to the throne than the current ruler. If those claim holders could find supporters, they could easily start civil wars and perhaps even replace the ruler one day.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6|Interesting. Where can I find these claim holders?
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:close_window|I guess I heard enough already. Thank you.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6:tavern_traveler_pretalk|A claim holder's life would be in danger in his own country of course. Therefore, they usually stay at rival courts, raising support and hoping to find someone willing to champion their cause. I usually hear news about some of them, and may be able to tell you their location with some precision. But of course, I would ask for a little something for such a service.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_pretender_location|I want to know the location of a claimant.

; dlga_start:ranger_introduce_1|Hail and well met. I am Master Grazmak mo Senko, of the great city of Astapor, most favoured of the great Harpy, the jewel of the east and heir to the Ghiscari Empire!
; dlga_ranger_introduce_1:ranger_introduce_2|Greetings. Where is Astapor?
; dlga_ranger_introduce_2:ranger_introduce_3|Astapor lies in Slaver's Bay, close to the Isle of Cedars. The Good Masters, of whom I am amongst, deal with the most magnificent soldiers in the world, the Unsullied! Trained from childhood, they're the fiercest, most stalwart, most loyal soldiers in the world! None might stand before them! Being the barbarian that you are, I imagine that you are not familiar with the story of the Three Thousand of Qohor? Khal Temmo and his khalasar was defeated by three thousand Unsullied. Only four hundred remained at the end of the battle, but Khal Temmo was dead and so was all his sons and twelve thousand of his warriors!
; dlga_ranger_introduce_3:ranger_introduce_4|I see. You're selling slave soldiers. If they're really that good, why are they not part of every army in the world?
; dlga_ranger_introduce_4:ranger_introduce_5|Bah! Petty lords and knights, would-be kings and princes, filthy khals and greedy magisters, they do not understand warfare. They think any soldier is the same. The Unsullied training starts a age five and is from dawn to dusk. It is brutal, designed not only to teach them how to fight, but to strip away all individuality, empathy, and self-worth. Only one in three survive, and those that fail at any stage are killed. They are fully castrated - penis and testicles cut - and their manhoods burned at the altar of the Lady of Spears. They regularly consume an elixir called the Wine of Courage to deaden their sensitivity to pain. They will obey every command, even fall on their sword should you wish it.
; dlga_ranger_introduce_5:ranger_introduce_6|You have roused my interest Master Grazmak, what can you offer me?
; dlga_ranger_introduce_6:ranger_master_talk|Usually, we sell Unsullied by the century, so as to not split them up. They have a tendency to become fat and bloated. Keeping them together ensures that their discipline and fighting prowess keeps. However, I have heard worrying news from the east, talk of dragons and brimstones. So I am looking to settle down in this area and as such will only be able to sell Unsullied in small groups.
; dlga_start:ranger_master_talk|Hello again, {playername}.

; dlga_ranger_master_talk:custom_master_reassign_location|I would like you to take up residence somewhere else.
; dlga_ranger_master_talk:ranger_master_customize|Can you tell me the history of Slaver's Bay?
; dlga_ranger_master_customize:ranger_master_talk|When the Doom came to Valyria, the ancient and proud cities of Astapor, Meereen and Yunkai rose once again to prominence. We deal in slaves, and it has made us rich and powerful. The Meereenese train slaves of all sorts, while the Yunkai specialize in bedslaves. In Astapor, we train the Unsullied, the heirs of the lockstep legions of Old Ghis. Further to the south, New Ghis claims to be the true heir to the Ghiscari Empire, but I say it is we, the masters of Astapor, who are the true descendants of Grazdan the Great!

; dlga_start:minstrel_1|Greetings to you, {most noble lord/most noble lady}.
; dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_job_description|What is it you do?
; dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_questions|I have some questions about courtship.
; dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_poem|Can you teach me any songs?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach|I can teach you the song, 'The Storming of the Castle of Love.' It is short enough to be easily learned. It is an allegoric poem, replete with symbols and metaphor. It describes how a brave prince from the Stormlands wins the heart of his lady by learning the virtues of chivalry, becoming a true and noble knight. Its theme -- that the role of a woman is to inspire but also civilize a man -- is appreciated by some noble ladies, but not all.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.1|I can teach you the song, 'The Maidens Desire.' It is a lyrical poem, which can be interpreted either erotically or spiritually. The lover realizes the majesty of the Seven by gazing upon the body of his beloved. I believe that it appeals to women of a certain romantic temperament, but you risk scandalizing or boring others.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.2|I can teach you the tragic ballad of the Rains of Castamere. It's a fairly recent song, commisioned by Lord Tywin Lannister after his victory over the rebellious lords Reyne and Tarbeck. They denounced their allegiance to the old Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, Tytos Lannister, but his son and heir Ser Tywin soon had them regretting their pride.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.3|I can teach you part of the song of Florian and Jonquil. It is a heroic tale, full of blood and battle. Florian the Fool sees the highborn maiden Jonquil bathing in the pool near Maidenpool. He is taken with her, but sadly she is promised to marry the King of the Rivers and Hills, a vain and cruel man. Knowing that he will never be allowed to even kiss her, Florian challenges the arrogant king to a battle of arms and wits for the hand of fair Jonquil.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.4|I can teach you the song The Bear and the Maiden Fair. It's a rather ribald song, mostly enjoyed in Westeros by lowborn and highborn alike. It describes in a humorous tone the story of three boys, a bear and a goat going to a fair, where the bear rescues a young innocent maiden who was hoping for a knight.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2|To teach it to you, I will need some hours of your time -- and, of course, a small fee for my services. About 300 silver coins would suffice.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_pretalk|I believe you already know the songs I am best equipped to teach.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3|Yes -- teach me that one

; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|What do you wish to know?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_prequestions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|Can I answer any other questions for you?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_role|Is there a place for me in the game of love?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_meet|How would a suitor meet a lady?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo|Having met a lady, how would the suitor woo her?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_nobles|Tell me about marriage and love among the nobility
; dlga_minstrel_nobles:minstrel_nobles_2|Nobles are an odd lot. A daughter is a political asset, to be given away to a lord with whom her father wishes to make an alliance. Yet the great families of this land idealize pure love between man and woman, and I have seen many a hardened warrior weep copious tears at the doomed ardour of Jonquil and Florian in the songs -- even as he made plans to break his own daughter's heart.
; dlga_minstrel_nobles_2:minstrel_nobles_3|Fathers differ, of course. Some nobles will let their daughters choose a husband who pleases them. Others, however, feel that to allow their daughters any choice at all would be to diminish their own authority, and insist on imposing a groom whether she likes it or not.
; dlga_minstrel_nobles_3:minstrel_prequestions|But the majority will steer a middle course -- they will want to make the final decision about a groom, but will weigh their daughter's preferences heavily. Among other factors, a happy marriage is more likely to produce heirs. So, there is a place for courtship, and for the use of skill and passion to win a lady's heart.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_daughter_father|What if a lady and her father disagree about a suitor?
; dlga_minstrel_daughter_father:minstrel_daughter_father_2|It happens sometimes that a bride elopes. This is a major blow to the father's prestige, leading to lasting enmities. Indeed, it is possible that a war may be fought over a woman. Now, that is a fine topic for a song.
; dlga_minstrel_daughter_father_2:minstrel_prequestions|In the end, however, most brides will submit to their parents' choice. A noblewoman's family is everything to her, and few are brave enough to risk its disapproval for the sake of man she barely knows. She may pine for her lover, but still accept the groom -- and without tragic love, what would we have to sing about?
; dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_player_role_2|Of course! Highborn ords make a great deal of lineage, but in the end, lands and money speak louder than one's ancestors. Even though you are a foreigner, if you are coming up in the world, then many parents will consider you a fine catch.
; dlga_minstrel_player_role_2:minstrel_player_role_3|You will have to compete with many other lords of your realm, however, who will have an advantage -- they have known these ladies from childhood, and will have been sized up as grooms by carefully discerning mothers and aunts. Some ladies may be fascinated by the stranger, yet opt for the familiar.
; dlga_minstrel_player_role_3:minstrel_prequestions|So know this -- you may have your heart broken. But to enter the arena of love fearing heartbreak is like entering the battlefield fearing the enemy's arrows. Be brave, and shrug off the sting of rejection, and victory may yet be yours.
; dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_female_player_3|I will speak bluntly. Most of the {ladies/lords} of this land are looking for a demure {lad/maiden}, whose skin as fair as snow -- and your skin is burnt brown by the sun. They want a {boy/maiden} whose voice is soft as bells -- and your voice is hoarse from commanding {soldiers/men} in battle. Also, although the {ladies/lords} of this realm appreciate poems about love, most also want heirs, and few {men/women} can ride and fight while {caring for their children/with child}.
; dlga_minstrel_female_player_3:minstrel_prequestions|However, not all {ladies/lords} will be so conventionally minded. We poets sing of shield {boys/maidens} and of {hunters/huntresses}, of {lads/women} who forged their own path without having sacrificed the chance for love. I would not tell you that it would be easy for you to find a devoted {wife/husband} who will accept your ways, but I would not say that it is impossible.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_spouse_benefits|What advantage is there in seeking a {wife/husband}?
; dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may forge a strong alliance with the bride's family, and a wife may also assist you in manipulating the politics of the realm to your advantage.
; dlga_minstrel_wife_benefits_2:minstrel_prequestions|What's more, most of the great families have at some point intermarried with royalty, which would boost your own claim to rule -- should you ever choose to assert it...
; dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2.1|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may have access to the groom's castles and properties, and be able to work with him to advance both of your standings in the realm.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet:minstrel_player_advice_meet_2|Every so often, a king or great lord will hold a feast. In towns they will often be accompanied by jousting and a melee, and in castles they will be accompanied by hunts. The feasts provide a chance for the lords to repair some of the rivalries that may undermine the strength of the realm. They also provide an opportunity for families to show off their eligible daughters, and ladies will often be allowed to mingle unsupervised with the guests.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet_2:minstrel_prequestions|If you have the opportunity, you may attempt to pay the lady a compliment. This indicates to her that you are a potential suitor, and she will usually know if she wishes you to continue your suit. Incidentally, if you come to her fresh from having distinguished yourself in the tourney or in the hunt, then you may make a stronger first impression than otherwise.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo:minstrel_player_advice_woo_2|To woo a lady takes a certain amount of time and patience, and several meetings spaced over a period of months. A lady who is interested in you will often find ways of letting you know if she wishes you to come visit her. Alternately, you may simply go and ask her father or brother for permission. If you do not have permission from her guardian, it may be possible to arrange an assignation through other means.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo_3|Having arranged an assignment, you may then attempt to charm her and win her favor. Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of this is finding a topic of conversation. Most noblewomen lead a cloistered life, at least until they are married, and thus will have little to say that will interest you. On other hand, she will soon tire of hearing of your own deeds in the outside world.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_3:minstrel_player_advice_woo_4|One time-tested mode of courtship is simply to recite a popular poem, and discuss it. This way, you are both on an equal footing, and neither will have an advantage in knowledge or experience. Of course, different ladies will have different tastes in poetry.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_4:minstrel_player_advice_woo_5|At some point, you will be able to discuss directly the issue of marriage. She will then let you know if you measure up to what she wants in a husband. Some ladies will coolly assess who is the most prestigious of her suitors, others will be guided by their passions. Some will look to your companions, to see whether you are the kind of husband who will treat her as an equal, while others will follow the lead of their fathers.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_5:minstrel_prequestions|At any rate, it is a challenging business -- and do not forget, you may find that your suit prospers with a lady, only to have it falter on a father's political ambitions. So you must ask yourself: are you willing to risk disappointment and heartbreak? Alternately, are you willing to throw away your standing in society, to make enemies of allies, in pursuit of a forbidden love? Because if you are, then perhaps some day we will write poems about you.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_job_description|What is it that you poets and musicians do again?
; dlga_minstrel_job_description:minstrel_courtship_prequestions|I compose and write songs for the lords of the land, and their ladies. Sometimes I sing about war, sometimes about the virtues of kings, and sometimes, for the more sophisticated audiences, about the virtues of wine. For most audiences, however, I sing of love.

; dlga_start:close_window.125|Hmph!
dlga_start:bayle_introduce_1|Yarr, co po mě chceš?
dlga_bayle_introduce_1:bayle_introduce_2|Jsem {playername}. Kdo jste vy?
dlga_bayle_introduce_2:bayle_master_talk|Kapitán Bayle Neres, pán Pikantní dívky, nejrychlejší lodi v tomhle přístavu.
dlga_bayle_master_talk:bayle_master_customize|Kam máte namířeno?
dlga_bayle_master_customize:bayle_master_customize2|Směrem do Yunkai s kořením, skvělým vínem a slonovinou. Máme volnou kajutu, pokud se k nám chceš přidat. Cesta je dlouhá a nebezpečná a poplujeme blízko Valyrie, ale je zde velká příležitost k zisku. Kajuta však není levná, bude tě to stát 2000 zlatých.
dlga_bayle_master_customize2:bayle_master_customize3|Dobrá, tady jsou peníze.
dlga_bayle_master_customize2:close_window|To je příliš!
dlga_bayle_master_customize3:bayle_finish|Dobrá tedy, vyplouváme okamžitě!
dlga_bayle_finish:close_window|Skvělé!
dlga_bayle_master_talk:close_window|Omluvte mě.
dlga_start:bayle1_introduce_1|Ah, {playername}!
dlga_bayle1_introduce_1:bayle1_introduce_2|Zdravím, kapitáne. Je šance, že se poplavíte směrem na Yunkai v brzké době?
dlga_bayle1_introduce_2:bayle1_master_talk|Vskutku ano, {playername}.
dlga_bayle1_master_talk:bayle1_master_customize|Nepředpokládám, že máte volnou kajutu?
dlga_bayle1_master_customize:bayle1_master_customize2|Ale ano mám, mám! Bude tě to stát 4000, pokud se chceš dostat do Yunkai.
dlga_bayle1_master_customize2:bayle1_master_customize3|Dobrá, tady jsou peníze.
dlga_bayle1_master_customize2:close_window|To je příliš!

dlga_start:bayle1_introduce_1.1|Ano, co se děje?
dlga_bayle1_introduce_1:bayle1_introduce_2.1|Kdy dorazíme do Yunkai?
dlga_bayle1_introduce_2:bayle1_master_talk.1|Chvíli to potrvá, {playername}. Nejprve musíme proplout přes Valyrii.
dlga_bayle1_master_talk:bayle1_master_customize.1|Slyšel jsem námořníky mluvit o nějaké Záhubě. Můžete mi říct víc?
dlga_bayle1_master_customize:bayle1_master_talk|Lidé tvrdí, že Záhuba se stále drží nad Valyrii. Cokoliv to znamená. Vše co vím je, že většinu výprav, která se dostane příliš blízko k ruinám, už nikdy nikdo nespatřil. Říká se, že velké prázdné síně dračích pánů obývají démoni.
dlga_bayle1_master_talk:close_window.1|Díky za váš čas, kapitáne.
; dlga_start:close_window.126|The wind should pick up soon, I can feel it in my bones.
dlga_start:bayle2_introduce_1|Ano?
dlga_bayle2_introduce_1:bayle2_introduce_2|Co je tahle nepřirozená mlha?
dlga_bayle2_introduce_2:bayle2_master_talk|Prokletí Valyrie.
dlga_bayle2_master_talk:bayle2_master_customize|Řekněte mi víc.
dlga_bayle2_master_customize:bayle2_master_talk|Valyria byla kdysi spojena s pevninou Essosu. Když ale přišla Záhuba, hory se rozštěpili vedví a chrlily obrovské množství roztavené horniny. Obrovské zemětřesení ničilo kontinent a moře se vřítilo do Valyrie a přeměnilo ji v souostroví. Hory Čtrnácti ohňů Valyrie jsou teď potopeny, ale i přesto jejich plameny stále žnou a moře se nad nimi vypařuje.
dlga_bayle2_master_talk:close_window|Díky za váš čas.
; dlga_start:close_window.127|This fog is horrible. Monsters and pirates could lurk in it.

dlga_bayle3_introduce_2:bayle3_master_talk|Už to nebude dlouho trvat.
dlga_bayle3_master_talk:bayle3_master_customize|Můžete mi něco říct o Yunkai?
dlga_bayle3_master_customize:bayle3_master_talk|Yunkai je známé také jako Žluté město. Leží na východním pobřeží Otrokářského zálivu, blízko ostrova Yaros. Yunkai je proslulý výcvikem a prodejem otroků do postele. Všichni ti otroci se učí Způsobům sedmi vzdechů a Šestnáct sedel potěšení.  Jednoho z nich si také musím koupím, už je to dlouho co jsem naposledy měl ženu.
dlga_bayle3_master_talk:close_window|Díky za váš čas, Bayle.
; dlga_start:close_window.128|We should be able to see the Island of Yaros soon.

dlga_merry_introduce_2:merry_master_talk|Jsem Meralyn, ale lidé mě nazývají Merry. Mám největší pár prsou tady v Braavosu a já a moje dívky tu činíme mnoho snů skutečností.

dlga_merry_master_customize:merry_master_customize2|Je mi líto, ale už jsem příliš mnoho let strávila na zádech. Můžeš se podívat jestli je volná Lanna. Je jí čtrnáct, je to čerstvá květinka. Je drahá, ale stojí za všechno to zlato, to ti slibuji!
dlga_merry_master_customize2:merry_master_customize3|Podívám se, jestli ji najdu.

dlga_sailors_wife_master_customize:sailors_wife_master_customize2|Chtě{l/la} by sis mě přehnout? Je to levné, pouze 5 zlatých. Samozřejmě si mě musíš nejprve vzít. Nejsem žádná děvka! Jeden ze septonů nahoře nám udělá obřad, vždy ho provedou.
dlga_sailors_wife_master_customize2:sailors_wife_master_customize3|Tak tedy nahoru, ženo.
dlga_sailors_wife_master_customize2:close_window|Promiň, nemůžu si tě dovolit.
dlga_sailors_wife_master_customize3:sailors_wife_finish|Ale jistě, {manželi/ženo}, vezmi mě do postele. Jsem tvá červenající se nevěsta.

dlga_daughter_dusk_introduce_2:daughter_dusk_master_talk|Oh, {playername}, ty nejsi odsud, že ne? Lidé z Braavosu mě nazývají dcerou soumraku. Jsem kurtizána, což je hezké označení pro děvku. Jediný rozdíl mezi mnou a těmi děvčaty okolo je ten, že já si vybírám své milence a také jsem jsem mnohem zkušenější než ony.
dlga_daughter_dusk_master_talk:daughter_dusk_master_customize|Zdáš se upřímná na, ehm, paní noci.
dlga_daughter_dusk_master_customize:daughter_dusk_master_customize2|Co bych měla říct nebo udělat? Můžu lichotit svým milencům, smát se jejich hloupým vtipům a říct jim, jak se mi z ni třesou kolena. Ale takové triky jsou spíš pro ženy jako je Bellegere nebo Královna Mermaid. Já mužům říkám krutou pravdu světa a platí mi za to stejně dobře, jako za to co mám mezi nohama. Tuším, že to Bellegere dělá také, ale není tím známá.
dlga_daughter_dusk_master_customize2:daughter_dusk_master_customize3|Má paní, vaše upřímnost je osvěžující.
dlga_daughter_dusk_master_customize2:close_window|Dáma by měla být vidět, ne slyšet!
dlga_daughter_dusk_master_customize3:daughter_dusk_finish|Jsem si jistá že ano, {playername}, stejně jako si jsem jistá, že by sis {uřízl/uřízla} vlastní ruku, aby ses {dostal/dostala} na to mokré místo mezi mýma nohama. Bohužel teď mám milence, se kterým si to užívám. Kdyby ne hned bych tě vzala nahoru do mých komnat. Máš takový uličnický obličej, co se mi líbí.

; dlga_start:close_window.132|I'm afraid I cannot talk right now, I'm trying to deduce some events.

; dlga_black_pearl_introduce_2:black_pearl_master_talk|The common people of Braavos call me the Black Pearl, and talk in secret of my wicked ways and illustrious ancestors. My real name is Bellegere Otherys.
; dlga_black_pearl_master_talk:black_pearl_master_customize|Who are your illustrious ancestors?
; dlga_black_pearl_master_customize:black_pearl_master_customize2|Oh, one of the Targaryen kings. Aegon the Unlikely to be frank, which does put a damper on the illustrious part. He sowed his seed with more vigor than most farmers, and had a crop to match. Say, {playername}, are you looking to make a name for yourself? I can help you along, in return for a favor. I am, by far, the most powerful woman in Braavos, adored by the common folk and lusted after by the princes. A kiss from me would put your name on everyones lips, and your name would become common knowledge in the city. All I ask in return is that you keep in mind the favor you owe me, to be repaid at a later date.
; dlga_black_pearl_master_customize2:black_pearl_master_customize3|I should conquer Valyria for a kiss from you, my lady!
; dlga_black_pearl_master_customize2:close_window|My lady, I fear I cannot be in debt to a woman as lovely as you!
; dlga_black_pearl_master_customize3:black_pearl_finish|Very well then, {playername}, meet me by the balcony. The light will make both of us look lovely, and my dress becomes positively transparent in such light, if you stand close to me.
; dlga_black_pearl_finish:close_window|Right!
; dlga_black_pearl_master_talk:close_window|Excuse me.
; dlga_start:close_window.133|I'm afraid I have an audience with the Iron Bank soon, {playername}, and I have to prepare myself.

; dlga_bella_master_talk:bella_master_customize|Which battle was that?
; dlga_bella_master_customize:bella_master_customize2|Oh, the Battle of the Bells. When the king hid here, Lord Connington came to root him out. But then the lords Stark, Tully and Arryn descended on the town, and they defeated the army of the Mad King! Leslyn says my mother was the kings favorite, and that he rung her bell more than any of the other girls. Makes me the kings bastard daughter I suppose. Anyhow, you can have me for 3 silver.
; dlga_bella_master_customize2:bella_master_customize3|I've never slept with a kings bastard before. Let's go upstairs.

; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window|I suppose Septon Germund is the man you'd talk to. Hear him tell it, he used to live a life of adventure down in the south. He's not here right now, but come back later, I'm sure you'll find him. Never far off when it comes to ale and wenches, even though he's a septon.
; dlga_start:close_window.140|What?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk|Greetings. I am Germund, the septon of this part of town. I used to live in the castle, but alas, Lord Manderly does not take kindly to those who would filch saffron from his private stores...
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2|Any news from the castle?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window|I have other things to do than to listen to a senile old man. Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.6|Yes, {playername}. Maester Theomare had a raven a few days ago, from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. We've been told to keep a watch out for wildlings, Cotter Pyke writes that they've grown ever bolder. One can only imagine, with the watch dwindled to next to nothing, and a new King-Beyond-the-Wall!
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.1|All very good, but how does that effect me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:close_window|Excuse me, I have important matters that require my attention.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.4|We haven't seen any wildlings here for years, but we haven't had visitors from Hillhall in quite a while either, though they used to come here to sell their iron. They've had a special relationship with the port officials for aeons, had dispensation granted to them by one of the old Stark lords. Cregan, I think. It's been much too long since they came here last, now that I think of it. I need you to go and take a look at the village, see if anything is wrong.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.1|I suppose I can go take a look.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window|I have better things to do than to visit some far away village. Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.1|Oh, splendid! The village lies close to the Bay of Seals, north of Karhold. Should you find anything, travel bach here and speak with Gerold, he's a recruiter for the Night's Watch, and he can take your findings back to the Wall. Along with whatever lost souls he finds in the dungeons.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window|Very well, I'll return once I've scouted the village.

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.1|Wildlings, {my lord/my lady}! They come during the night, put the village to the torch! Horrible, t'was!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5|My name is {playername}. I've been sent to scout out the village. Tell me where the wildlings went.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.1|I don't know {my lord/my lady}, but they can't have gone far! Mayhaps they went for another of the villages, greedy savages that they are. Maybe Goodwife Myra over at Last Hearth have heard something, she's the biggest gossip in the realm. She works in the kitchens, along with that daughter of hers. My ma always told me kitchens are where all the important news comes through first. She should have known, worked in one for a while.
dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:pj_wildfire_talk8|Jak to že jsi přežil útok divokých?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk8:close_window|I hid in the top of that huge pine over there. Saw their savagery though! T'was horrible {my lord/my lady}, horrible.

Sleep with giants, snarks and worse.

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.2|Oh gods no! Haven't seen a wildling since I was but a wee child. Big shaggy man he was, put an axe in the blacksmiths skull.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.1|Do you know of any who might have seen or heard anything?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.2|Talk to my daughter Jess. Foolish girl, she been talking to all kind of travellers passing through.

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.3|Forgive me, {my lord/my lady}. I did not see clearly who spoke to me.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk4.1|Your mother seemed to think that you may have heard about some wildlings.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk4:pj_wildfire_talk5.1|Yes, {my lord/my lady}. They come over the Wall, Willam said, though Halbert said they sail across the Bay. Then again, what do they know. Josmond said he'd heard m'lords talk about wildlings in the Lonely Hills, close to that old abandoned holdfast. Now, {my lord/my lady}, I'm sure you can tell me much more about these wildlings than any of those boys. Mayhaps you could tell me about them in the back of the barn?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.3|No. I don't lie with filthy peasants.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk7|Might be I could.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:close_window.1|Forgive me, {my lord/my lady}, is just that I saw your fancy clothing, thought you might fancy me!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk7:close_window|Oh my! Come then, take me in the barn, {my lord/my lady}!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.2|Nothing, I'm leaving.

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.4|Saw a fist in the snow, the dead was crawling all over it! Saw a dark shape in the north! It speaks to me, whispers! Saw wild men too, but they're my brothers now! Beneath the ground we'll lie, but not yet! When the dawn is ended, I'll have my bride, my cold bride, in the snow and in the dirt!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.2|Tell me where the wildlings went. Now.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window|Hah! Heh! No! You can't have them! He gave them to me, they're mine to play with! In the cold north, the night reigns. And then they'll kill me! A big happy family we are! Come, come, I'll show you!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:nacroxnicke_creditos|Who are you?

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.4|Septon Germund sent me.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.5|Is that so? What does the old knave want? More saffron, or is it one of Lord Manderlys nieces he's got his eye on this time? Or perhaps a cousin? Heh.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk4.2|No. He sent me to track down a band of wildlings that had burned the village of Hillhall. My journey ended north of the Dreadfort, in the Lonely Hills, where I found the wildlings. They where cold as ice, yet still they walked. Their eyes where blue, without life. They where wights.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk4:pj_wildfire_talk5.2|We had a raven from the Lord Commander... Thought for sure that Aemons wits must have been wandering, but if you saw the same in the Hills...

Wights are not supposed to be able to pass beneath the Wall. It's not just ice and stone. Powerful magic was used to raise it, and it still holds to this day. These wights must have been reanimated here, not beyond the Wall.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:pj_wildfire_talk7.1|They where. I slew the man who did it.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk7:close_window.1|Gods be good! Return to Septon Germund at once, {playername}. He must be made to spread the word. The villagers must be armed. The Wall must hold!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.4|I forgot.
; dlga_start:pj_germund_talk|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_germund_talk:wildfire_espada|I found the wildlings. An old man had raised them from the dead, as wights!
; dlga_wildfire_espada:wildfire_espada2|This is dire news, {playername}! The Seven-Pointed Star warns of wights and revenants, shades and snarks! We must arm the villages, and warn the lords! And someone must send a raven to the Wall... Gueren can do that! And make sure our fires burn brigt! Speaking of fire, I have something that might come in handy, should you run into more of these creatures.
; dlga_wildfire_espada2:new_one_wildfire|Where did you get these?
; dlga_new_one_wildfire:close_window|Before I became a septon, I studied with the pyromancers of King's Landing. Old fools the lot of them! When I left them, I took these pots with me. Been a real nuisance having to transport them everywhere in barrels of sand, I tell you that! Be careful with them, they can't be refilled! And I certainly can't make any more of the substance!
; dlga_pj_germund_talk:close_window|I forgot.
; dlga_start:bye31|Greetings {playername}.
; dlga_bye31:close_window|Greetings to you too.
; dlga_start:clansman_starter_introduce_1|Yes? What do you want? Be quiet, or the young lord will be startled!. Wouldn't do to have him startled, he makes a mess when he twitches.
; dlga_clansman_starter_introduce_1:clansman_starter_introduce_2|Do you know of anyone who would happen to have a task for me?
; dlga_clansman_starter_introduce_2:close_window|The lady Lysa is the ruler of the Vale until young lord Robert comes of age. Seek an audience with her. She is currently sleeping, but come back later and I'm sure she'll find time for you.
; dlga_start:close_window.142|What?
; dlga_start:clansman_talk|Be quiet! You'll wake the baby! What do you want?
; dlga_clansman_talk:clansman_talk2|I am {playername}, my lady, and I've come seeking adventure. Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_clansman_talk:close_window|Farewell.
; dlga_clansman_talk2:clansman_talk3|Yes, {playername}, I do, I do. Those vile mountain clans have been causing all sort of chaos lately! Not three days ago, they assaulted a septa and her ward. Slew the brave knight guarding them. I wonder how they've gotten their hands on such pristine weapons... They need to be dealt with! The Vale will know what a strong and just lord they have!
; dlga_clansman_talk3:clansman_talk4|What can I do?
; dlga_clansman_talk4:clansman_talk5|Go out there and kill them, obviously! Talk to Ser Albar, Lord Nestors son. He'll know what to do, I'm sure.
; dlga_clansman_talk5:clansman_talk6|Where can I find him?
; dlga_clansman_talk6:clansman_talk7|Oh, how should I know? Do I have to do everything myself! Go look for him at the Bloody Gate, he often goes hunting there.
; dlga_clansman_talk7:close_window|Very well, I'll return once the clans have been dealt with.
; dlga_start:close_window.143|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk|I'm busy, go away!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2|Are you Ser Albar Royce?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3|Yes, what's it to you?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5|My name is {playername}. Lady Lysa sent me here, she believes you can help me dealing with the mountain clans.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6|Hah! A hundred generations of Arryns have tried to deal with those damn savages, I doubt you'll be able to do anything about them. The lady Lysa is a good and honest woman, but... she is, shall we say, prone to bouts of extreme optimism when dealing with matters like this. Still, I guess teaching the clans a lesson wouldn't be the worst we could do.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:pj_clansman_talk8|So you know where they are?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk8:close_window|Gods no! If I knew, I'd have gone after them myself. No one knows where they live, that's why they're never dealt with. The Mountains of the Moon are filled with caves and hidden valleys... Still, try and visit Jharys in Gulltown. He sometimes has dealings with the clans, but we let him get away with it because he helps us track down kidnapped maidens.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window|Hmph!
dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.1|Co chceš?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.1|Are you Jharys?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.1|Yes, yes, what's it to you?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5.1|Albar Royce seemed to think you might know where I could find the mountain clans.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.1|Hah, which one? There's a dozen! And no, I don't know where they are. Perhaps Ser Myles over at Coldwater Burn has heard something. That man is the biggest gossip, and drunk, in the Vale of Arryn. He knows everything.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window|You've been most helpful.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.1|No matter, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.2|What do you want, huh?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.2|Ser Myles? Jharys sent me, he told me you might know where to find the mountain clans?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.2|Oh no, haven't got a clue about them clans. Heard a juicy rumour about Mychel Redfort and Lyn Corbray recently though, and one about that singer at the lady Lysas court. Seems he's rather fond of young maidens, especially those yet to be spoiled by another man! But no, I have no idea where the mountain clans live.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk4|Do you know any who might?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5|Not really, no. Though perhaps... perhaps you could go ask my mother, lady Barbrey. She lives in Wickenden.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.2|Big help you are!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk7|Thank you, Ser Myles.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.1|Bah!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk7:close_window|Don't mention it.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.2|Nothing, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:order2.1|Grarh!
; dlga_order2:order3.1|What?
; dlga_order3:close_window.1|Die, tiny warrior!
dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.3|Co chceš?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.3|Lady Barbrey, your son sent me, he thinks you might know where to find the mountain clans?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.3|Bah, did he now! Could have told you himself, couldn't he? His father is the chief of one of those savage clans. Calls themselves the Moon Brothers. Bah! Guess you're done talking to me now, am I right? No one wants to talk to me ever since those savages returned me to my fathers keep, violated and big with child... Last I heard, the Moon Brothers had been seen close to Strongsong...
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5.2|Thank you.
dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:close_window|Zapomeň na to...
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:nacroxnicke_creditos|May I know more about you, my lady?
; dlga_nacroxnicke_creditos:close_window.1|No! Go away, and tell that drunken bastard son of mine he's as worthless as that pig of a father who begot him!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.3|Nothing.
dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.4|Co chceš?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.4|I've come looking for the Moon Brothers, have you heard anything?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.4|Yes, they where spotted not a mile from here! But we don't have the numbers to deal with them. As of late, the clans have grown wilder, and they bear sharp steel and heavy armor!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk4.1|I'll head out right away, and deal with them!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5.1|You'll do that now, will you?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.3|Well, I guess you might as well give it a go. I don't imagine you'll return, but here's a small parting gift. Never let it be said that the men of Strongsong don't reward bravery.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:pj_clansman_talk7|Thank you.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk7:close_window.1|My pleasure. I do hope you can do something about these savages.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.4|I forgot.
; dlga_pj_germund_talk:clansman_espada|I've slain the Moon Brothers, one less tribe of clansmen to trouble the Vale.
; dlga_clansman_espada:clansman_espada2|Trying to steal Ser Albars glory, eh? He came to me not an hour ago and told me how he and his knights had tracked down the savages and taught them who rules the Vale. I'll not have liars at the Eyrie, away with you! Just you wait till Lord Nestor hears of this!
; dlga_clansman_espada2:new_one_clansman|Erh...
; dlga_new_one_clansman:close_window|Go away!
; dlga_start:clansman_talk.1|Ah, {playername}! It's good to see you again!
; dlga_clansman_talk:clansman_talk2.1|Haldon mentioned that you might have further need of my skills.
; dlga_clansman_talk2:clansman_talk3.1|Yes, {playername}, I do, I do. I need someone to take a message to a friend of mine, in King's Landing. You know King's Landing, I assume? That big heap of fleas and poor souls strangling the mouth of the Blackwater Rush. Can't miss it, and even if you do, the smell will remind you that you're close.
; dlga_clansman_talk3:clansman_talk4.1|Where can I find him?
; dlga_clansman_talk3:close_window|Excuse me, I have important matters that require my attention.
; dlga_clansman_talk4:clansman_talk5.1|Oh, he's usually to be found in the Black Cells of the Red Keep. Outside them though, not inside. Works as an undergaoler in the cells.
; dlga_clansman_talk5:clansman_talk6.1|What is his name? How do I know whether I'm talking to the right person?
; dlga_clansman_talk5:close_window|On second thought, I think I'll stay out of this.
; dlga_clansman_talk6:clansman_talk7.1|My friend goes by the name of Rugen. I suppose he'll be dressed as a gaoler. Gaolers usually are. Helps mark them for what they are, that is. Gaolers, nothing else. How could a man dressed as a gaoler be anything but a gaoler.
; dlga_clansman_talk7:close_window.1|Very well, I'll bring Rugen your message.
; dlga_clansman_talk7:close_window.2|I can't carry that right now.
; dlga_start:close_window.144|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.5|Yes?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.5|Are you Rugen?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5.3|My name is {playername}. I've been sent by Illyrio Mopatis, all the way from Pentos, to bring you a message.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.4|Ah, yes, the message. Hmph, well done {playername}. Let's keep this between us, eh? Here's a bit of... ah... incentive.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:pj_clansman_talk8.1|Do you need me to bring back a message?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk8:pj_clansman_talk9|Well, ah, if you're headed back to Pentos, you might as well bring him my, ah, reply. You'll need to keep quiet about your doings, obviously.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk9:close_window|Very well.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk9:close_window.1|I can't carry that right now.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.6|Yes {playername}?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.6|Rugen asked me bring you his reply.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.5|Ah splendid, {playername}. You've been a great help. Would you be interested in doing me yet another favor?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5.4|Yes.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.5|I need you to bring a chest of... valuables... to an acquaintance of mine. A knight, by the name of Rolly Duckfield. I've arranged for him to wait in a tavern in Norvos. Bring him the chest, and I'll make sure you're well rewarded.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.2|Very well.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.3|I can't carry that right now.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.5|No matter, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.7|What do you want, huh?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.7|Ser Rolly? Magister Illyrio asked me to bring you this chest.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.6|Ah good, good. But Griff says our plans have changed, and I'm afraid I can't carry this with me if we're going to get the boy to Selhorys in time. You'll need to return this to Magister Illyrio, with my apologies.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk4.2|Who are you talking about? Take it back?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5.2|Ah shit. Nevermind. Just bring the chest back to Pentos, and talk with the fat man. Tell him we're heading west instead of east.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.6|I'm not a pack mule!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk7.1|Very well.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.4|Bah!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk7:close_window.2|Thanks, friend.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.6|Nothing, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.8|Yes, {playername}? How very good to see you. Did you get the chest to Norvos?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.8|I did, but your friend had me bring it back here.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.7|What? Why? Did he give you a reason. Speak man.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk5.5|He said something about a boy, Selhorys and going west?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.7|Curse that man! Griff is too impatient! We've been keeping him secret for sixteen years, and now we're running out of time?! We'll have to act quickly, {playername}. Go back to King's Landing and tell Rugen what you've learned. No, better yet, bring him this letter.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.5|Very well.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:close_window.6|I'm afraid I can't carry a letter right now.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.7|Nothing.
dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.9|Co chceš?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.9|I'm looking for a man named Rugen.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.8|Ah, Rugen! An unsavory fellow. Not like myself. I'm of royal blood myself, you see.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk4.3|What are you talking about?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5.3|I'm descended from the natural born son of a Targaryen princess. My mother told me the story. My ancestor was such a strong, brave and handsome warrior, that even a princess could fall in love with him. She told me he was a captain of a ship, a man who braved even the storms of the Cape of Wrath.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.8|Their son was born a bastard, but a royal bastard! My fathers father added the 'Long' before 'Waters'. We're a noble family of knights carrying royal blood, you see. Couldn't have a name as lowborn as 'Waters'!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:pj_clansman_talk7.1|Oh, I don't care! Do you know where Rugen is?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk7:close_window.3|He's in the tavern. I swear it on my royal blood!
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.8|I forgot.
; dlga_start:pj_germund_talk.1|Ah, {playername}.
; dlga_pj_germund_talk:clansman_espada.1|Magister Illyrio asked me to deliver this letter to you.
; dlga_clansman_espada:clansman_espada2.1|Well, ah, then. Give it here.
; dlga_clansman_espada2:new_one_clansman.1|Well?
; dlga_new_one_clansman:new_one_clansman2|I am in your debt, {playername}. Here, please accept this gift as a sign of my gratitude.

; dlga_new_one_clansman3:doran_martell_quest|Ah, {playername}, you'll know in time, in time. Suffice to say, the men of the Sunset Kingdoms are all the same. They sew some beast upon a scrap of silk, and suddenly they are all lions or stags or eagles, but black or red, a dragon is still a dragon. But ah, I need you to do one last thing for me...
; dlga_doran_martell_quest:doran_martell_quest1|I need you to visit a winesink in Sunspear, called the Thirsty Goat. Look for a man called Septon Allard, and deliver the letter to him.

; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5.4|Hmm...
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.9|The prince must hear of this. Visit the castle and deliver this letter to Maester Caleotte.

; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.9|I forgot.
; dlga_start:pj_clansman_talk.11|Yes?
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:pj_clansman_talk2.11|I was told to bring you this.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk2:pj_clansman_talk3.10|Ah yes... {playername}, Magister Illyrio speaks highly of you in this letter, you've done the prince a great service.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk3:pj_clansman_talk4.5|I'm glad.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk4:pj_clansman_talk5.5|Hmm...
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk5:pj_clansman_talk6.10|It seems to me that the magister did not offer you a suitable reward for the great risks you've faced... I will make sure you receive a proper reward, on the understanding that not a word of what you've accomplished for us ever leave your mouth... Words are like arrows, once loosened you cannot call them back, and one stray arrow can bring down even a prince.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk6:pj_clansman_talk7.3|I won't speak a word of what I've done.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk7:close_window.5|Good, good. Accept this as a proper reward for your accomplishments then, {playername}, and remember your vow. The storm is on the horizon.
; dlga_pj_clansman_talk:close_window.10|I forgot.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.1|Yes, can I help you?

; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.2|What would you have me do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.5|The Bastard of Bolton has been wrecking havock across the Lonely Hills. For his crimes, he has been sentenced to death. I need someone who can bring the kings justice to this monster of a man.

; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.1|Farewell.

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.3|No, but you will have to leave eventually. When you do, you die.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.1|Maybe it'll be you choking on your own blood! I will hurt you, I will flay you, and when I am done with you, you'll beg for death!

; dlga_order2:order3.2|We'll see about that!

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.7|Truly? Winterfell and the North is in your debt, {playername}. Ramsay Snow was not a man, he was a beast wearing a mans skin. I'll see to it that you'll be rewarded for this deed.

Who can tell what goes on in a peasants mind. He has made his home in the tavern. I also overheard Lord Swanns captain of the guards, Ser Clifford Gower, talk about some letters he needs delivered to some minor lord. Ser Clifford went out hunting this morning, but he should be back in a few hours.

; dlga_bank_talk_1:bank_pre_pretalk|That is all I wanted to know.
; dlga_bank_talk_zalozenie:bank_pretalk|Very well. Welcome to the Iron Bank of Braavos.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.2|What is it? I'm busy! All these acolytes, with their stupid questions!
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.2|Archmaester Harodon? Septon Garibald told me to deliver this letter to you.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.2|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.8|Oh who cares. Another septon, preaching to us about how our efforts are futile, that all truth lies with the Father Above. Bah! Bunch of sheep is what they are!
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.3|What do you mean?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.6|The Faith has been trying to curb our influence for hundreds of years. Feel like they should be the only ones spreading knowledge. Or their version of it, at least. Sheep is what they are, shackled in their huts of ignorance. Did you know that Baelor the Blessed was considering a request to bring the Citadel under the authority of the High Septon when he died? Good thing his uncle killed him, Viserys was a much better king. Didn't know that, did you? Oh, there's no written evidence, but sure as rain, Viserys murdered Baelor and took the throne.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.3|Very well...
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.3|Do you believe in the Seven, {playername}? That the Father Above watches you, the Warrior protects you, the Crone lights the way?
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.1|I do.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk9|I do not.
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window|Then to you I say 'bahhh'. Go rut around in the mud with the other sheep, and leave us enlightened men to continue our work.
; dlga_wildfire_talk9:close_window|Ah, a learned men is what you are then. Well done I say. Too many superstitious fools rut around in the mud, always looking for answers they'll never find. Marwyn could tell you all about what it's like to rut around down there.
; dlga_start:close_window.148|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.3|Yes? How can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.3|Who are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.3|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.9|An Archmaester of the Citadel! Though there's plenty of us around, these days the conclave will give any man who's read a book the title. Just look at Harodon. Bigger fool you'd have to search for far and wide. The Faith can be niggardly, stubborn, backwards and cruel, but the septons still hold more power than we'll ever do, advisers of lords and ladies though we are. It's unwise to antagonize those with more power than yourself.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk5.1|You won't hear me defend the septons though. They've burned more books than I care to think about. Imagine what we would know of the past, if it wasn't for Baelor Targaryen. All those books, gone, and for what? Some silly king, half a boy, who fancied himself more than a man, more than a king. Baelor saw himself as the embodiement of the Seven, a god made flesh.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.4|Very well...
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.4|It's all here in the books. The evidence. You just have to look for it. Plenty of people don't. They'll read some asinine book meant for bored lords and ladies, and think they understand the way the world works. But without proper training, how will they ever be able to see the world for what is really is. Bah, nothing worse than some uneducated know-it-all. But ah, enough of the rabble. More important things are afoot in the world. Did you know that the Citadel is always looking for lost works? Books, scrolls, ledgers. Would you be interested in procuring such items for us, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.2|I am interested.
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.1|Ah, good. Books are precious, you know. A single copy of Barths 'Unnatural History' would be worth more than a sword of valyrian steel. Imagine that, {playername}! Alas, Baelor was thorough in destroying all of Barths writings. But enough about that. If you want to help us conserve the knowledge of the past, travel to King's Landing. The Citadel employs a procurer in the city, who always scours the bookshops for unknown writings, but he often needs men who can travel further from the city and pick up books from other places. His name is Malko, you can find him on Coppersmith's Wynd. He runs a shop called 'Malkos Bookstore'. No one ever required the man to have a bit of imagination, but still...
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.4|I am not interested.
dlga_start:close_window.149|Ano?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.4|Ah, a customer! How can I help you, my good man?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.4|I've been sent by Archmaester Harodon.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.4|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.10|Joyous news! My last procurer had a nasty accident a couple of months back. Cut himself on a fine piece of vellum, and would you believe it, it turned gangrenous! Lost his whole hand. Sad story, so sad. At least it wasn't his right hand, he'll still be able to work as a scribe... 
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.4|What does a procurer do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.7|They procure books. I have many contacts throughout the Seven Kingdoms, and you wouldn't believe the kind of lost knowledge the lords and knights of the realm have hidden away in their cellars. Once, I found a piece of Septon Barth's 'Dragons, Wyrms and Wyverns: Their Unnatural History' being used as a tablecloth in the room of an old blind knight. Sold it to Tyrion Lannister for a king's ransom. Even the Citadel itself cannot outbid a Lannister. But they are my most persistent customers, the maesters.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.5|But what do you need me for?
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.5|I can't leave my shop to go gallivanting around the world looking for books, but I can't send a soft scribe in my place either. Even at the best of times, the roads can be hazardous. But you look like a tough sort, and I have work for someone tough. I've heard rumours of a book, hidden away in the Vale. It might be multiple books to tell you the truth. It's referenced in various texts, most notably in one of Barth's fragments. It goes by different names. The Dreams of Azathoth. Dead Names. But it's most often called The Mysteries of the Worm. Who knows which one is real. I think it's a myth, but imagine if not! We could sell the book to the maesters for unimaginable riches!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.3|It's very valuable?
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.2|Ah, not really. Marwyn writes that the people of Asshai tell tales of the book. It's supposed to be an introduction to all kinds of magic. Silly superstitions. But the maesters have labored long and hard to eradicate supposed 'magical' textbooks, and a find such as this could render many of their efforts futile. So they'd pay well to have it destroyed. According to my sources, a septon has been making mentions of a magical book in the north-western parts of the Vale. Go there and talk to him, {playername}, find out if there's any truth to the whole thing. I'll reward you handsomely, and here's a bit of an advance.
; dlga_start:close_window.150|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.5|A blessing, my good man? The Father Above is all the protection you need. Lay down your weapons and rejoice in his holy light.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.5|I'm looking for a book.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.5|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.11|What book?...
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.5|The Mysteries of the Worm?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.8|Never heard of it. Only book a godly man need is The Seven-Pointed Star. Everything else is just worldly knowledge, soon to be forgotten. Why waste your time with books about plants when you could show your devotion to the Seven instead?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.6|So you haven't heard anything about a book? It's supposed to be rare.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.6|Haven't heard anything about much lately. This is a remote corner of the world, my little place of worship. The smallfolk around here are simple, with simple needs and simple dreams.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.4|Do you know anyone who might have knowledge of books in the area?
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.3|Can't say I do. Though perhaps Ser Elston have heard something. His holdings are to the east of here, close to the foot of the mountains. We're very isolated here, but if anyone have heard anything about books, it's either Ser Elston or his maester.
; dlga_start:close_window.151|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.6|Terrible weather, isn't it? It feels... sour. Somethings wrong with it.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.6|What do you mean?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.6|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.12|This whole place is... wrong. Should have stayed on the road. Never wanted this. I'm Ser Elston Boone, the last of House Boone. Inherited these holdings from a distant cousin last year. Used to be a tourney knight. What a life, riding from town to town, not a care in the world. Now I'm shackled to this place.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.6|I'm looking for a rare book, and was wondering if I might consult with your maester?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.9|The Mysteries of the Worm? I can see from your reaction that's the one. Cadwyn has not been talking about anything else for weeks. Found it mentioned in some old papers left behind by one of my ancestors. Mentioned something about Witch Isle and the Upcliffs. Cadwyn was sure he could figure out where the book went... Did you hear that?! There's something in the walls. Perhaps it's just rats... but they'd have to be a monstrous size...
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.7|Can I talk to maester Cadwyn?
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.7|Afraid not, {playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.5|Why not?
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.4|He killed himself. Two days ago. Cut his own throat. Bad way to go. It's this sour air. It turns everyone mad. He rambled for days you know. Shouting about the Long Night. About great white spiders and wights walking up and down a wall... his trip to the barrow changed him... should never visit barrows, {playername}, the dead sleep better when not disturbed...
; dlga_start:close_window.152|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.7|Ah, {playername}! Tell me, did you find the book?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.7|I did not.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.7|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.13|Oh, what a shame. Just a rumor then, nothing to it? I hear all kinds of stories, most of them untrue. You wouldn't believe the nonsense tales that originate in remote hamlets.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.7|I did hear of a fragment of the book.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.10|You did? Tell me more!
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.8|A maester found a clue or a sliver of notes partaining to it. I tried to find where it was, but all I found was a crazed man who had sacrificed to an old tree. He'd written the name 'YGG' on a stone, with the blood of one of his victims.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.8|'Ygg', you say? How quaint. The ironborn tell tales of how their legendary ruler, The Grey King, carved the first longship from a tree called Ygg. Supposively, a demon lived in the tree, a demon with the power of foresight. Anyone who had their future told by Ygg would inevitable meet with tragedy. Ygg always chose to tell the future in a way that would cause the most pain to the world.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.6|Is the story true?
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.5|Ah, not really. How could it be. A demon living in a tree? Sounds like the maester you mentioned got caught up in some fancy tale of his own. But forget about that, {playername}. At least you tried to find the book. That's worth a reward.
; dlga_start:close_window.153|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.8|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.8|Ser Clifford? Septon Garibald told me you had need of someone to deliver a letter?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.8|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.14|Ah yes, I do. The maiden daughter of Symond Templeton, the Knight of Ninestars, is turning thirteen this next moon, and Ser Symonds uncles have decided to hold a tourney in her honor. My late wife was a Templeton by birth, making the young girl my niece by marriage. I've been invited to attend the melee, but my duties keep me here. However, I was always fond of my lady wife, and for her sake, I wish to send a name day present to the young girl.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.8|What can I do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.11|Take this letter, and this ruby ring which belonged to my lady wife, and deliver them to the castellan of Ninestars, he'll make sure the young maid receives them. Be mindful, however, that you do not upset her uncles - they're a querulous bunch. I'll make sure you're compensated for your troubles, {playername}, obviously.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.9|Very well, I'll do it.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.2|I'm afraid I can't carry all that now.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.9|Splendid! With all the chaos engulfing the realm, I imagine this will be the last great tourney in quite a while. While you're in the Vale, you should take the time to enjoy yourself. This summer has lasted a long time already, there's no knowing how much time we have left before winter arrives and we all have to huddle around our fires.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.5|Very well, I'll take a look at the tourney while I'm there.
; dlga_start:close_window.154|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.9|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.9|My lord? I'm looking for the castellan. I've brought a gift and letter from Ser Clifford Gower.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.15|Oh well, I'm the castellan of Ninestars, so you've found your man. Ser Clifford you say? By the Seven, we haven't heard from him in years. How is the old rogue doing? Oh, nevermind, how would you know. You said something about a gift? And a letter? I doubt Rowena can even remember Ser Clifford, not with all those great-uncles of hers taking up all her time and attention. Ser Symonds father had seven brothers, can you believe that?! Boisterous and arrogant the lot of them.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.9|Here's the letter and the gift.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.12|Ah, thank you {playername}, I do appreciate it. The young lady will surely enjoy this gift, the ring is an old family heirloom. I'll make sure she receives them right away. Say, while you're here, you should take a stroll around the grounds. A great many merchants and mummers have camped outside the walls, and they're sure to provide a great spectacle and much merriment.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.10|I'll do that.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.10|Good, good. Do stay around for the tourney, will you? We haven't had as many visitors as we hoped. The mountain clans have grown wild, and many knights and lords have decided to stay in their keeps and holdfasts, rather than risking the roads. It was different when Jon Arryn ruled the Vale, then those vile savages wouldn't have dared show their face unless they had ten times the numbers we do!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.6|Very well, I'll take a look at the tourney while I'm there.
; dlga_start:close_window.155|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.10|{playername}. What where you thinking? The knight you attacked is Ser Raymun Templeton, Ser Symonds youngest uncle. What a mess, the man is infuriated. Let me ask you this, {playername}, how good of a fighter are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.10|I can hold my own.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.16|Doesn't say much, does it? What a vague answer. You're a guest here, {playername}, and an unknown one at that. You struck a relative of the Knight of Ninestars, outside his own castle. Ser Symond would be in his right to cut off the offending hand. But Ser Raymun was never his favorite uncle, nor is he a friend of mine, so it's been agreed that you will be judged by someone other than Ser Symond. As it happens, I will be one of the three judges at your trial.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.10|Then why are you here?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.13|Why indeed. Ser Raymun and I have never been fast friends. To tell you the truth, I despise the man. However, the other two judges are his brothers. I'm the castellan of Ninestars, and a knight of House Tollett, my word carries weight in these parts, and I will urge the judges to be merciful. However, you struck the youngest brother of the two other judges, so there's a risk you'll wake up tommorow without a hand. There is another option, though.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.11|Tell me.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.11|You stand accused of assaulting a relative of the Knight of Ninestars. The judges will be unlikely to look upon your case with favorable eyes. But if you demand a trial by combat, you might be able to prevail. So I ask you again, {playername}, how good of a warrior are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.7|I see.
; dlga_start:close_window.156|Sleep on it, {playername}, the trial starts tommorow.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.11|{playername}! Hah! Did you see the look on Raymuns face? That bastard got a surprise there, no denying it. But can you defeat him? I admit, I know nothing about you, except for your ability to hit knights right on the nose. Are you a knight yourself?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.11|Yes.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2_no|No.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.17|Oh well, that makes everything so much easier. A knight! Really? Splendid. Do you have own armor? Sword, helmet, horse? Ah well, either way, I would be honored if you'd let me provide all you need. {playername}, during the trial, did you notice how some of the knights and ladies seemed to approve of your request? Ser Raymun is not well loved, and there's been stories... peasant girls have complained before... either way, I think that not only the smallfolk but a great part of the nobles will be on your side during this fight. Why, you ask? Well, a knight is sworn to protect the weak. You remembered those vows.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2_no:wildfire_talk3|Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter. Do you have own armor? Sword, helmet, horse? Ah well, either way, I would be honored if you'd let me provide all you need. {playername}, during the trial, did you notice how some of the knights and ladies seemed to approve of your request? Ser Raymun is not well loved, and there's been stories... peasant girls have complained before... either way, I think that not only the smallfolk but a great part of the nobles will be on your side during this fight.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.11|I suppose so.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.14|Do you know the rules of trial by combat, {playername}? The fight ends when either party yields or is killed, or when the accuser takes back his accusation, or when the accused declares himself guilty. You'll need to either kill Ser Raymun, or force him to yield and withdraw his accusations.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.12|Very well.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.12|I don't imagine there's much more to say. The trial is tommorow, I suggest you get some sleep. Ser Raymun was never a great warrior, but he's not unskilled either.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.8|I see.
; dlga_start:close_window.157|Sleep on it, {playername}, the trial starts tommorow.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.12|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.12|Are you from Cairnhall?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.9|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.18|Ah yes, yes, I am Tom, the Elder sent me here to find a knight, true and honorable!
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.12|Erm, yes... Septon Garibald said you'd been having problems with a... wight?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.15|Yes, yes, a revenant, a wight, a ghost! Saw it myself, only three weeks ago! Pale and with red eyes, it was flying through the night, in a crate made of bones! Made me shiver, make no mistake! The men of the village agreed with me, we need an faithful man to slay the beast, a knight, like Aemon the Dragonknight, from the stories!
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.13|Hmm... perhaps I could take a look at this wight myself.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.3|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.13|Are you a knight? Oh, I'm sorry, of course you are! My father always told me the city was full of knights! Go to my village and slay the revenant, brave Ser! It haunts the old cairn, sure as day!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.9|Very well, I'll go have a look.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.10|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.158|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.7|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.7|Have you seen a wight about here?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.7|Hmph!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.8|By the Seven, another one? Look, I'm not a wight, as I tried to tell that screaming girl when she came up here. I've been sent here by the Citadel to do some excavating, and I'll be gone in a day or two. This cairn really is a marvelous treasure trove. Found a cache of scrolls from before the Conquest, and tablets speaking of the Battle of the Bloody Pool.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.4|You seem to have caused quite a stir in the village. Why didn't you just explain to them what you where doing here.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.2|Ah, but then I'd have to explain to them what 'excavating' means, and before you know it, they're coming to me to bless their cows, heal their wounds and wed their daughters. Keep ignorant peasants away from me, and I can die a happy man.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.8|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.8|Tom, I've taken care of the... wight.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.9|Truly? Well done, Ser! I knew a true knight would have no trouble dealing with such a demon! Any man who is shrouded in his faith can withstand such a beast, the septon was right! Here, please take this, as a thank you!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.1|Thank you, Tom.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.2|Can you tell me more about Cairnhall?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.2|Well... we grow a lot of beets... turnips too, now that I think about it.
dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.8|Zapomeň na to.
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.3|Who are you?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.2|I'm here to forge my chain and become grandmaester... Say, are you looking for work? Maester Yandel said he was looking for a courier.
; dlga_start:close_window.159|What?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.13|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.13|Are you Yandel?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.10|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.19|Ah yes, yes, I am Yandel. Who are you, and how can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.13|One of the acolytes said you where looking for a courier?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.16|Ah yes, quite, quite. I do. I have been working on a momentous tome these past years. I call it 'The World of Ice and Fire'. Beautiful work. Dedicated to king Robert, but now I suppose it should be dedicated to his heir... Either way, some of the illuminators in Lannisport have been working on a copy for the king. They do great work there, letters in gold and scarlet like you wouldn't believe. And I especially enjoy their work on sigils, it's like the krakens are getting ready to strangle the reader!
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.14|And?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.4|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.14|Ah, I need someone to pick it up and deliver it to me. They're excellent craftsmen in Lannisport, but before I have the tome delivered to the king, I should like to check it for spelling errors. Wouldn't do to let the king be disappointed! And to tell you the truth, I quite enjoy looking at the pictures. Can you pick up the book? I'd do it myself, but I can't bear to be gone from the archives for long. So many mysteries! I'll make sure you're rewarded for your troubles.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.11|Very well, I'll go get the tome.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.12|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.160|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.9|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.9|I'm here to pick up a tome for Maester Yandel.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.9|Hmph!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.10|Ah yes, very good. The ink finished drying not three days ago. It's quite beautiful, and I'm sure the king will be pleased. We used the same scarlet as the one Lord Tywin had us use for his invitation to the wedding of the king and queen, Lannister colors you know. That will be 500 coins for the work we've done. The Citadel has already paid for the materials.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.5|Very well.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.3|Here we are! The finest book ever made, I'd say. I had a look through it while the apprentices worked. The craftsmanship is like nothing anyones ever seen before, but you must give my regards to Yandel. The text is quite interesting as well.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.2|I can't afford that.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.10|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.10|I've returned with the tome.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.11|Ah, very well. Yes, this is beautiful work indeed. Those apprentices know what they're about. Look at those dragons, it's almost as if you can feel the heat coming off them. Here's a little recompense for your troubles, {playername}.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.3|Thank you.
dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.10|Zapomeň na to.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.3|Well met, {playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.4|How do you know my name?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.3|I am Gueren, a brother of the Night's Watch. Gerold told me about you, {playername}, and how you handled that mad bastard up in the old holdfast. The latest raven from Aemon told of troubles at the Wall, perhaps you could head up there and see what's going on. Or maybe take the black yourself, the Wall is not picky.
; dlga_start:close_window.161|The Wall must not fall, {playername}.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.14|Yes? Who is it? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.14|Maester Aemon? Gueren said you'd been having some sort of trouble lately?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.11|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.20|Ah, Gueren. Troubles he says. We're in dire need of help, {playername}. Lord Commander Mormont went north with near a third of our strength. Only a few have returned. The Watch is sorely weakened, and the realm is disunited and in chaos. We can expect no help from any of the kings.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.14|How can I help?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.17|One of our brothers, Jon, recently returned to us. He had been pretending to join the wildlings, and he has brought us valuable information of their whereabouts and intentions. Jon left the wildlings just south of Mole's Town, and we have every reason to believe they might still be somewhere in the area. Jon says they're led by a man named Styr, the Magnar of Thenn. Magnar means 'lord' in the Old Tongue, but even a lord amongst the wildlings will want to loot and burn a town such as Mole's Town.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.15|Hmm... what do you want me to do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.5|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.15|We have assembled a force of men to intercept the Magnar and defeat his band of raiders, but Bowen Marsh has gone west to defend the Shadow Tower with the remaining part of the garrison, and we need someone to led them. Jon is still too weak to leave his bed, and Donal Noye must stay here to led the defenses. The rest of our brothers are eager, but they do not have the experience. Gerold mentioned your deeds in the Lonely Hills, and I trust his judgement. You must led the brothers of the Night's Watch against the Magnar, {playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.13|Very well, I will defeat the Magnar!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.14|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.162|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.11|Yes, {playername}? Is the Magnar dead? 
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.11|The Magnar is dead.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.12|Truly? This is joyous news, {playername}. You have bought us valuable time to arm ourselves against attack. While we prepare for the inevitable, I need someone to visit Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and tell Cotter Pyke of the events here. Will you do this?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.4|I will, Maester Aemon.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.3|May I know more about you?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.3|Ah, {playername}, there is much and more to know, but none left to tell my story. Egg is long gone...
dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.11|Zapomeň na to.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.15|Yes? Who are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.15|Maester Aemon sent me, with news from Castle Black.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.21|Well, out with it then. I'm not some pampered knight, I feel no need to waste time with idle yammering.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.15|The wildlings are approaching the wall. We stopped them in Mole's Town.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.18|Well then, I guess we're saved for another day, eh? I don't see why Aemon couldn't send a raven with these news. Why are you here? Ah, I see. He wants me to send my men to Castle Black, to defend it against the attack? Just because that fool, Bowen Marsh, had to gallavant off to defend against an obvious diversion! Fine! Tell Aemon I'll send as many men as I can spare, I'll even send Emmett with them. The lads worth three experienced rangers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.16|Very well, I'll return to Aemon with these news.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.6|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.16|Good! And tell Bowen he's a fool while you're at it!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.15|Erh, yes...
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.16|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.163|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.12|Farewell.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.12|Yes, {playername}? What did Cotter Pyke say? 
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.12|He's sending as many men as he can spare to aid us in the defense.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.13|Good, good. It probably helps that Bowen is absent, he can't stand the man... {playername}, I need you to travel to the Shadow Tower, and visit Ser Denys, and see what has happened to Bowen Marsh and his men. They've been gone for a long time, and the men of the Shadow Tower can guard the Gorge as well as the men of Castle Black. We need them here, to defend the Wall against Mance Rayder.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.5|Very well.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.4|Can you tell me about Castle Black?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.4|Ah, {playername}, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me. Perhaps you could ask Clydas...
dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.12|Zapomeň na to.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.16|Yes? Who are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.16|Maester Aemon sent me, for news of Bowen Marsh.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.22|Ah, very well. But you're not my brother, are you? Ah, no matter, no matter, we need all the help we can get. Lord Marsh was well the last time I saw him, {playername}. He took most of my men to the Gorge, to guard the Bridge of Skulls.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.16|The Bridge of Skulls?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.19|Ah, you haven't heard of it. The Bridge is the only way across the Gorge, a large, well, gorge, very deep. The wildlings often descend the Gorge, to bypass the Wall. We'd had news that a large force of wildlings where in the area, so Lord Marsh took the greater part of our strength to defend the Bridge.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.17|Cotter Pyke said Bowen Marsh was a fool for falling for the diversion?...
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.7|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.17|Cotter Pyke! Bah! The bastard son of a tavern wench, the most vile man in the entire Watch, an ironborn bastard, half a wildling himself! Still, I myself might not have been so quick to take the greater part of our strength with me to guard the Gorge... Ah, nothing to do about it now. In fact, {playername}, I'd greatly appreciate it if you where to head to the Gorge yourself. Should the wildlings attack, Lord Marsh could use all the help he can get!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.17|I'll have a look at this Gorge!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.18|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.164|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.13|Farewell.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.13|Yes, {playername}? How fares Lord Marsh? 
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.13|The Weeper tried to force his away across, but we beat him back.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.14|Good, good, {playername}. But the wildlings are sure to descend on Castle Black at any moment now, you must hurry back and lend whatever aid you can. The Wall has stood for eight thousand years, we'll make sure it still stands after this King-Beyond-the-Wall is in his grave.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.6|Very well, Ser Denys.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.5|Can you tell me about the Shadow Tower?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.5|Ah, {playername}, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me, Maester Mullin is the scholar here.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.13|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.17|{playername}. Is Bowen still alive?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.17|Barely, Maester Aemon. What happened here?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.23|Another party of wildlings attacked us, but we beat them back. Alas, the true battle has only just begun, {playername}. They have been digging throuhg the Wall, and they've managed to make a breach into one of the storerooms. The lower part of the wall is vulnerable in a very few places, if it had been anyone but Mance Rayder leading them, they would have never known where to dig.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.17|What can I do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.20|Join the fight, {playername}. The stewards are holding the wall, raining down arrows on the wildlings. Jon has taken the remaining rangers and are holding off the wildlings in the tunnels beneath the Wall. Join him and defend the realm, {playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.18|Where is the breach?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.8|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.18|Just west of here. Make haste!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.19|For the realm!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.20|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.165|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.14|Farewell.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.18|Yes? Ah, {playername}. What news do you bring?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.18|We beat back the wildlings.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.24|Ah, very well. But I fear our position is untenable. It would have been different if the Watch had been at full strength, but our forces have dwindled over the years... we face a position unlike any in our long history.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.18|What do you mean?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.21|Time and time again, the wildlings have thrown themselves against the Wall. Raymund Redbeard, Bael the Bard, Joramun... but this time, it is different. We are a shadow of our former selves, and the Stark in Winterfell has gone south. There is no one to defeat the wildlings when they make their final attack on the Wall.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.19|But we beat them back in the tunnels!
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.9|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.19|A test, {playername}. Mance Rayder has men to spare, and we have none. We cannot hold them off, but we can continue the fight! You must go to Jon and tell him to evacuate Castle Black. A Lord Commander could never do so, but Lord Mormont is gone, and we've yet to chose a successor. I can order the brothers to go south, and join the northern lords in their holdfasts and castles. We have no commanding officers, and I am the oldest brother of the Night's Watch still alive. The high lords cannot accuse me of cowardice, no sane man would wish to live to my age.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:wildfire_talk8.7|But ah, before you go... a gift. When I joined the Order of Maesters, I forswore my old family name, but I have not forgotten it. When Bloodraven left for his last ranging, he entrusted me with the sword his father bestowed upon him. The sword that Aegon's sister Visenya wielded when she rode upon Meraxes, one of the three great dragons. The ancestral valyrian sword of House Targaryen! It is called Dark Sister, and its history is illustrious and proud. You must wield it now, {playername}, and defend the realm, as the kings should have.
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.6|I am honored, my lord.
; dlga_wildfire_talk8:close_window.7|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.166|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.15|Farewell.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.14|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.14|Aemon has ordered you to abandon the Wall.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.15|We're sworn to guard the realm! There’s no shame in fear, my father told me, what matters is how we face it... Arh, Maester Aemon has the right of it! We could throw away our lives here, and it would barely slow down Mance and his army! We'll retreat to Winterfell, and join the lords when they march on the wildlings.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.7|For the realm!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.6|Can we hold the Wall?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.6|We're sworn to hold the Wall.
dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.14|Zapomeň na to.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.4|Yes? Another adventurer, come to our great city, eh? Looking for valyrian steel?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.5|Tell me more.
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.4|The best craftman in the city is Elos Mott. He's the master of the Guild of Blacksmiths. If you're interested in valyrian steel, talk to him.
; dlga_start:close_window.167|Good luck.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.19|Yes? I am Elos Mott, leader of the Blachsmiths of Qohor, most gifted of all the craftsmen in the world. Welcome to my shop.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.19|Cetherys said you could tell me about valyrian steel?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.16|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.25|Ah, the bane of my existence! Everyone wants to know about valyrian steel. Why, I ask, when one could also learn about tinted metals, armor strong enough to withstand the blow of a warhammer, or even the precious substance the alchemists call wildfire. But no! Always valyrian steel... travellers and adventurers, princes and archons, they all come asking about the steel of Valyria.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.19|What would you have me tell you, that no one does not already know. Valyrian steel is precious. A drunk in a tavern could tell you that. Valyrian steel is indestructable. The same drunk would tell you the same truth. Valyrian steel is the rarest material in the world, worth lordships and fiefdoms. All the drunks in the world know this.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.22|But can I, the master of blacksmiths, reforge valyrian steel? Yes. I can. Can I make new valyrian steel. Well... time will soon tell. Remember the fate of Maester Pol, and do not inquire into my work, or the work of my colleagues. The city watch will have you if you do, and so will the disciples of the Black Goat.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.20|But you can reforge valyrian steel?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.10|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.20|Yes, I can. Any member of the guild can. However, we do not provide the steel. Even if we had such materials at hand, Tywin Lannister has already paid us good, solid, gold to reserve it for him. No, {playername}, I will gladly reforge a blade for you, but you will need to gather the materials yourself. We once forged a new blade for the lysene nobleman Moredo Rogare. Truth, he called it. It was forged from four daggers of valyrian steel, and the cost was enough to outfit an entire fleet of ships. Gather enough daggers, and I will be able to forge for you a new blade of pure, indestructable, valyrian steel, worthy of a king, a prince, even a dragonlord.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.21|Very well.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.22|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.168|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.20|Yes? Ah, you again. {playername}, I really do not have anything else to tell you about valyrian steel...
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.20|I have gathered the four daggers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.17|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.26|Truly? That is quite wonderous, {playername}, I did not think that would be possible unless you where to sack one of the other Free Cities. You did not do this deed, no? No sacking of those heathens occured in the search for these daggers, I can rest easy, yes?
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.20|Ah yes, these daggers are exquisite indeed. Forged in the fires of the Freehold. But ah! Forged anew in Qohor, the greatest of the Free Cities, heir to Old Valyria! The Black Goat will surely appreciate our sacrifice, and grant us the good fortune that we may create a blade such as the world has never seen before.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.23|Now, while these daggers certainly are of valyrian steel, they are not overly large. I can create a blade for you, but I cannot extend the metal or supplant it. You will have to be content with a short sword, but a sword it will certainly be. I can fashion it into whatever shape you desire. Which would that be?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.21|I desire a blade with a curved crossguard.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.22|I desire a blade fit for stabbing.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.23|I desire a short arming sword.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.11|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.21|Very well. I shall craft you such a blade. The process is laborous and costly. I do not haggle, and will name my price once the blade is ready. Return to me shortly, and the blade shall be ready for you.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.23|Very well.
; dlga_start:close_window.169|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.21|Welcome, welcome, traveller, to the Alchemist's Bend! Built in shadows by a sinister cabal of sorcerers and magi! According to the smallfolk. It wasn't really, you know. The last Hightower king, Lymond the Sea Lion, built it. How can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.21|I'm looking to buy some valyrian steel.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.18|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.27|Truly? Why, I have a huge pile just lying over here, by the basket of apples!
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.21|Hah! No, I don't. Valyrian steel... We do have some, it's true, but it's locked away down in the vaults, and I doubt Marwyn would part with the key. What would you need it for, anyhow? If you're considering becoming an acolyte, you can earn your own link in time...
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.24|Ah, I just realised, {playername}, that I do not care that much. This is the workshop where we do delicate work, and I really have to get back to the forge. What can I do for you that will make you leave?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.24|Tell me where to find valyrian steel.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.12|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.22|Fine. Take this list. Archmaester Mollos compiled it a couple of years ago. Gods knows why. It was part of a larger treatise on daggers... but still. Say, do you plan to visit the blacksmiths of Qohor? Pol did once. They are monsters. They reforge valyrian steel, it's true, but to do so, they practice blood magic. Blood sacrifice, slaves and infants slaughtered on the altar of the Black Goat.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.24|Thank you.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.25|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.170|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.22|Ah, {playername}. A joyous day, this. We have made something not often seen since the Doom came to Valyria so many years ago. Praise be to the Black Goat, the Harbinger, the Whisper in the Darkness, the Worm that Doth Come.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.22|So it is done then?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.19|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk5|It is done, and a fine blade it is. Our craft has grown stronger as of late, and the candles are once again burning. The Black Goat certainly has favored us in this endeavor, and we in return have sacrificed to the most fearsome of gods. Now there is the matter of our payment. We shall require 20000 coins for this most magnificent weapon, as the process of crafting it is not without its cost. Is this agreeable?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.25|It is.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.26|It is.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.27|It is.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.13|Not right now.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.23|Very good. If you should ever happen upon more steel, return to us and we will continue our work together, and make the secrets of Old Valyria unravel before us.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.26|Very well.
dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.27|Nemám zájem.
; dlga_start:close_window.171|Yes?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.6|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.5|Hah, yes, go bugger yourself. Or go see Lord Tyrion, you look the right sort for the work he offers. He's probably in the tower.
; dlga_start:close_window.172|Fuck off.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.23|Yes? Can I help you? I suppose you've come here at the behest of Bronn? The man's been sending me all kinds of queer folk to me these past days, sellswords and rogues the lot of them.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.23|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.20|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.28|Ah yes, I do. Tasks I have aplenty. The city lacks food, soldiers, weapons and proper queens, but I have more tasks than I know what to do with.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.22|What would you have me do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.25|Most of the lords of the Crownlands have sworn their allegiance to the king, but those close to the sea have been... unreliable in their support. Ser Jeffory Darke has not seen fit to appear at court, and has been riding around the countryside, spreading rumors of Joffreys parentage. It won't do. Look at the boy, it's clear who his father is.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.28|What do you want me to do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.14|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.24|The lords need to know that we won't tolerate such behavior. Ser Jefforys uncle was the one who alerted us to his nephews behavior. The king has seen fit to sentence Ser Jeffory to death, and grant his lands to this uncle. We need someone to carry out the sentence, but I don't want a long, drawn out, siege. Sneak into Ser Jefforys keep and put an end to him and his scheming.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.28|Very well, I will execute Ser Jeffory on behalf of King Joffrey.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.29|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.173|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.15|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.15|The uncle, I assume?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.16|I am Ser Rike Darke, yes, the uncle of Ser Jeffory.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.6|The king appreciates your help in putting an end to your nephews plotting, Ser Rike, and congratulates you on your ascension to master of Brookwater Keep. What a fortuitous circumstance, that you might serve your king, and gain a proper reward. Ser Jefforys father and grandfather might be proud.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.4|Yes, well...
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.15|Hmph!
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.16|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.16|Lord Tyrion, I've taken care of Ser Jeffory.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.17|Truly? Well done, {playername}. I'll make sure Bronn spreads the proper rumors about his demise. Should keep the rest of the lords in line. How did the uncle take it? Slimy worm, isn't he? Here, have this. One of my men found it in the castle cellar, supposively it belonged to Aemond the One-Eyed. It's old and worn, as you might expect of something that had a valyrian sword through it, and was then submerged in water for ten years, but it does have quite a story surrounding it.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.8|Thank you, my lord.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.7|May I know more about you, my lord?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.7|I am Tyrion Lannister, Hand of the King.

; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.24|How do you know my name?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.21|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.29|I saw it in the fires.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.23|What would you have me do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.26|Find the answers.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.29|Erh...
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.15|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.25|Go north. Visit the fort of shadows. The Nightfort.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.30|Very well...
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.31|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.175|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.25|{playername}.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.25|How do you know my name? Who are you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.22|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.30|I saw your birth, and heard the name your mother bestowed upon you while you lay at her breast. I'm watching everything, and everyone, with a thousand eyes and one.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.24|How?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.27|The trees see all, and time is of no importance to them. The weirwoods hold many memories. My presence here is their memory.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.30|But how? I don't understand.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.16|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.26|The weirwoods will show you. Eat this paste, and you'll see.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.32|Very well...
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.33|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.176|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.26|Taste this pie! It's filled with gravy, onions, bacon and prince!
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.26|It's filled with prince?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:close_window|Tasty prince! The king wronged me, and now he'll pay! HE WILL PAY! The voices told me! They told me that the king was jesting about my knives! The voices... they have cold, blue, eyes...
; dlga_start:close_window.177|Tasty prince, tasty bacon, crazy king! Where's my children?!
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.27|Arh! The cold hurts! He's bound us!
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.27|Who has bound you? What are you talking about?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:close_window.1|HE bound us. With cold and blood, he's bound us to his will!
; dlga_start:close_window.178|Kill me! Please kill me!
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.6|Yes?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.8|Do you know of anyone who might have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.7|My uncle, Ser Gilbert, is looking for someone to do some... un-knightly work. He was here a minute ago, perhaps if you return later you can find him.
; dlga_start:close_window.179|Praise the Lord of Light.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.28|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.28|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.23|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.31|Ah yes, I do, I do. But you have to keep silent about this.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.25|What would you have me do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.28|Before the Old King abolished the lords right to the first night, the Targaryens where known to visit the smallfolk of Dragonstone to take their due, and they continued to do so even after the right was abolished. The resulting offspring was known as 'dragonseeds'. The dragonseeds used to be plenty on Dragonstone, but their numbers have dwindled over the years. However, recently a young man has been claiming to be the bastard son of Prince Rhaegar.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.31|Hmm... go on.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.17|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.27|This young man, going by the name of Lacerys, has been meeting with some of the knights from Hull, known to be descended from the Velaryons, and thus being akin to the dragonseeds. According to one of my informers, a man named Burlow, they've been talking of sneaking into the castle and overwhelming the guard, take the king hostage, and proclaim this Lacerys the true king of the Seven Kingdoms. This cannot be allowed to happen. I need you, {playername}, to break up the conspirators and execute the lot of them. They meet mostly at night, or when the fog rolls in from Dragonmont, obscuring the streets. We don't want to cause a scene, so just kill them and leave the bodies to be found.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.34|Very well, I will execute these conspirators.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.35|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.180|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.17|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.17|Burlow, I assume?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.18|Indeed I am, {playername}. Ser Gilbert told me you'd be coming.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.7|What do you think, Burlow? Was Lacerys the son of Rhaegar?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.5|Hah, that prancing fool? Not a chance. Plenty of silver-haired young men here on Dragonstone, the Targaryens had years to plant plenty of seeds. You'd be hard pressed to find someone without a bit of dragonblood on this island.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.17|Hmph!
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.18|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.18|Ser Gilbert, I've taken care of the conspirators.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.19|Truly? Well done, {playername}! His Grace, the king, has given me permission to choose a suitable reward from the armory in The Stone Drum. One of the weapons was rather fascinating. Taken from a Braavosi smuggler some years ago, it appears to be one of their slender blades, but forged for two hands rather than one. I imagine it would prove a rather poor cutting weapon, but it might prove to be exceptionally lethal as a stabbing tool. And of course, a monetary reward is due!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.9|Thank you, Ser Gilbert.
dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.18|Zapomeň na to.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.8|Can you tell me more about the dragonseeds?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.8|I don't know much more than the next man. Perhaps you could go talk to Archmaester Perestan in Oldtown, he's devoted much of his life to the history of Westeros.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.7|Yes?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.9|Do you know of anyone who might have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.8|I did hear a rumor a few days ago... Phario Forel, the playwright, is looking for someone to search some old tomb... he'll probably be here in a couple of hours, for some reason he's infatuated with Merry...
; dlga_start:close_window.181|Yes?
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.29|Yes? Can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.29|Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.24|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.32|'The Father reached his hand into the heavens and pulled down seven stars and one by one he set them on the brow of Hugor of the Hill to make a glowing crown'...
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.26|Erh?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.29|It's from the Seven-Pointed Star you ignorant savage! Bunch of Westerosi nonsense, but they did get the crown part right. Of course, it's not made by a god...
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.32|Hmm... go on.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.18|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.28|The Andals wrought many fine treasures out of gold and copper. I have every reason to believe one of them might be buried in an old barrow, close to the Ruins of Iksa Calo. I need Andals treasures for my next play! The barrow is supposed to be haunted by wights and the ghosts of the Andal kings, but it's obviously just the wild rumours of madmen.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.36|Very well, I will search for your Andal treasues.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.37|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.182|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.19|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.19|I didn't find any Andal treasures.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.20|Truly? Oh the curse of the sea upon that old fool! The Third Sword swore that I'd find what I seek in that barrow!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.10|Well...
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.9|Can you tell me more about the Seven-Pointed Star?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.9|Read it yourself!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.19|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.8|Erh, yes?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.10|My lady, may I know more about you?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.9|No... but perhaps you can acquire my favor by helping out a dear friend. Find Moredo Tendyris and talk to him. He's probably in the tavern, he has a weakness for music.
; dlga_start:close_window.183|Go away.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.30|Yes?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.30|Lady Mellario said you where looking for help?
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.33|Ah yes! Caravans have been disapperaing in the Pass of Hugor Hill. I suspect a band of outlaws might be using one of the caves as a hideout.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.27|What do you want me to do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.30|Go and search for the cave, and kill any outlaws you find
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.33|Hmm... go on.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.19|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.29|You'll need to deal with the outlaws yourself, you'll never be able to surprise them by lumbering around with half an army.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.38|Very well, I will take care of the outlaws.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.39|I am not interested.
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.25|Farewell.
; dlga_start:close_window.184|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.20|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.20|I took care of the outlaws.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.21|Well done {playername}! A reward is in order!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.11|My thanks.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.10|Can you tell me more about the Pass of Hugor Hill?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.10|Nothing to tell, really. The pass got its name from Hugor Hill, obviously. Everything in the highlands is named after some Andal religious figure.
dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.20|Zapomeň na to.
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.31|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.31|Did you have any more tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.26|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.34|Ah yes, I do. A close friend of mine has gone missing. He was visiting some ruined baths, north of Myr, but neither I, nor my associates, have heard from him since he set out weeks ago. He was supposed to be back by now. Foolish thing to visit baths, especially ruined ones, but there you are.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.28|What would you have me do?
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.31|Go look for him. If he has met with an unfortunate end, I need you to return any books or scrolls he might carry, but I pray that is not the case. But find out what happened to him, {playername}!
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.34|Hmm...
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.20|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.30|I'll make sure you're well rewarded!
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.40|Very well, I will find this friend of yours.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.41|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.185|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.21|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.21|Hmph!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.21|Are you Illyrios acquaintance?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.22|Indeed I am, {playername}. My name is Haldon, and I appreciate the help. I've been looking for... nevermind. Anyhow, I ran into these bandits and they had me at their mercy when you came to my rescue.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.8|Glad I could be of help.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.6|I'm sure the magister will reward you handsomely for your work, {playername}. You seem an able fellow, and he might have... work for you, so visit him regularly.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.22|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.22|I found Haldon and rescued him from a band of bandits.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.23|Well done, {playername}! I think a reward is in order!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:close_window.12|Thank you.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:morcant_creditos.11|Who is Haldon?
; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.11|Oh, just an old friend of mine. We call him 'Halfmaester' on account of him being almost a maester, but not quite.
dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.22|Zapomeň na to.
; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.9|What are you doing here? This is the private estate of Magister Mopatis!
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.11|Who is this magister?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.10|He's one of the magisters of Pentos, you dolt! He should be back soon, and when he's back, he'll make you regret this trespassing! But if you have urgent business with him, you can find him at the court in Pentos.
; dlga_start:close_window.186|Get out of here!
; dlga_start:wildfire_talk.32|Welcome, my friend. I see you just barged in, without an invitation, but welcome nonetheless. What are you doing here, if you don't mind me asking?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:wildfire_talk2.32|I am {playername}, and I've come seeking adventure. Do you have any tasks for me?
; dlga_wildfire_talk:close_window.27|Farewell.
; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.35|Yes, {playername}, I do, I do. I need someone to brave the Smoking Sea, and set sail for far away Meereen. An... acquaintance of mine has taken up residence in the city, and I would dearly like to keep in contact with her, and thus I need someone to deliver this letter. So what do you say, {playername}, are you man enough for such a journey?
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.29|I will brave this Smoking Sea and sail to Meereen!
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:close_window.1|I'm afraid I can't carry that right now.
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:wildfire_talk5.32|Splendid! You'll be well rewarded, I can assure you that. Once you reach Meereen, seek out Belandra Kheranes, she'll help you on your way. And just between us, if you where to bring some of your own coin with you on the journey, you might be able to make an excellent profit bringing back some spice. Now, sadly, my own ships are all away at sea, so you'll need to find your own way to Meereen.
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:wildfire_talk6.35|Where can I find a ship?
; dlga_wildfire_talk5:close_window.21|On second thought, I think I'll stay on land.
; dlga_wildfire_talk6:wildfire_talk7.31|Travel to Volantis, and you may be able to hire a ship there. Visit the tavern and see if you can't find Bayle Neres. He's an old rogue, not averse to travelling past Valyria. For the right price.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.42|Very well, I'll return once I've seen Meereen.
; dlga_wildfire_talk7:close_window.43|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.187|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.23|I'm busy, away with you!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.23|Are you Belandra Kheranes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.24|Yes, what's it to you?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.9|My name is {playername}. Illyrio Mopatis sent me to seek out a friend of his and deliver this letter. I was told you could help me get in contact with this person?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.5|Ah yes, {playername}, I can. The one you're looking for is named Barristan Selmy. If you head to the throne room, I'll make sure he'll meet you there.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:pj_wildfire_talk8.1|What if I he's not there?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk8:close_window.1|What if, what if. Don't worry, {playername}, he will be.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.23|Hmph!
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.24|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.24|Barristan Selmy? I've been sent with a letter.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.25|Magister Illyrio has been a steadfast friend of the queens cause. I thank you for bringing me this, {playername}. Did you bring any additional messages from him?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.10|No, he simply tasked me with making sure you received this letter, but he also asks that you keep him informed of your intentions.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.6|Very well, {playername}. I'll have Missandei see to it that Magister Illyrio is kept aware of our intentions. Perhaps you should speak to Skahaz mo Kandaq, if you want to continue serving our cause, he may well have tasks for you.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:close_window.2|Thank you.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.24|Nevermind.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.25|Yes?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.25|Skahaz mo Kandaq? Ser Barristan told me you might have tasks for me?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.26|Looking for work then? I believe I have a task for you, if you're man enough to handle it. Few are, but that's the general condition of people these days. Fret not, Meereen will be made great again.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk4.3|Very wel.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk4:pj_wildfire_talk5.3|My family has many dealings with the Free Cities. Her grace has, in her wisdom, outlawed slavery, and it's imperative that we find new ways to keep our markets full. To that effect, I've decided to send one of my own merchant vessels toward Tyrosh, that we might establish some small link with the trade of the Narrow Sea. But first the ship has to traverse the Stepstones, a notorious haunt of pirates. The lyseni cleared the islands a year ago, so the pirates have not yet been able to recover their strenght, but on the island of Bloodstone, there's an inkling of a new stronghold. I need you to go there and dispatch the pirates making it their home.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:pj_wildfire_talk6.7|I'll clear out these pirates.
dlga_pj_wildfire_talk6:close_window.3|Dobrá tedy, bylo mi potěšením, {playername}.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.25|Nothing, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.26|What do you want?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.26|I'm looking for the pirates who have recently made Bloodstone their home.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.27|They ain't here right now, they all went to the south of the island. Was going to prey on some myrish galley they said. Can't be a big galley, there's only eight of them, hah. What's it to you anyhow?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.11|None of your concern!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.7|Alright, alright, no harm done.
; dlga_nacroxnicke_creditos:close_window.2|Guardsman. I'm just guarding this here gate.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.26|Nothing.
; dlga_start:pj_germund_talk.2|Yes, {playername}
; dlga_pj_germund_talk:wildfire_espada.1|I've returned from the east.
; dlga_wildfire_espada:wildfire_espada2.1|Wonderful, {playername}! Did you find Ser Barristan? Is he well? Here, take this gift as my way of thanking you! Perhaps you'll be wanting to make use of it once the queen claims her rightful throne, eh?
; dlga_wildfire_espada2:new_one_wildfire.1|Thank you, magister.
; dlga_new_one_wildfire:close_window.1|It's nothing, nothing! Say, should you wish to earn riches beyond your wildest dreams, then return to me in a couple of hours, I might have more work for you. There's always more work to be done, and little time. Men and events are converging, and soon all will change.
; dlga_start:mercenary_tavern_talk|Do you have a need for sellswords? {reg3?Me and {reg4?{reg3} of my mates:one of my mates} are:I am} looking for a master. We'll join you for {reg5} silver coins.

; dlga_mercenary_after_recruited:mercenary_after_recruited_2.1|Take your time. We'll be staying in this town for a while.
; dlga_mercenary_after_recruited_2:close_window|Yes {Ser/my lady}. We'll be ready when you tell us to leave.
; dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:mercenary_tavern_talk_hire|All right. I will hire all of you. Here is {reg5} silver coins.
; dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:mercenary_tavern_talk_hire.1|All right. But I can only hire {reg6} of you. Here is {reg5} silver coins.
; dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk_hire:close_window|{s17}
; dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:tavern_mercenary_cant_lead|That sounds good. But I can't afford to hire any more {reg65?soldiers:men} right now.
; dlga_tavern_mercenary_cant_lead:close_window|That's a pity. Well, {reg3?we will:I will} be lingering around here for a while, if you need to hire anyone.

; dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:close_window|Sorry. I don't need any other men right now.
; dlga_start:trainer_intro_1|Good day to you {lad/lass}. You look like another adventurer who has come to try {his/her} chance in these lands. Well, trust my word, you won't be able to survive long here unless you know how to fight yourself out of a tight spot.
dlga_trainer_intro_1:trainer_intro_2|Díky za tvou radu. Tohle místo vypadá jako cvičiště. Možná bych se tu mohl něco přiučit?
dlga_trainer_intro_2:trainer_intro_3|To rozhodně ano. Jsem zkušený bojovník... bojoval jsem v mnoha bitvách za svých časů. Dnes však už jen cvičím mladé z okolí. Můžu ti najít pár soupeřů, se kterými můžeš cvičit, pokud chceš. Nebo pokud máš nějaké otázky ohledně teorie, tak se ptej.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4a|Ano, pár otázek mám.

dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Ah, jsi {připraven/připravena} pro nějaké ten trénink?
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_practice_1|Jsem {připraven/připravena}.
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|Nejprve mi něco pozvěz o soubojích...
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|Už musím odejít. Na viděnou.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|Co chceš vědět?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|Co dalšího chceš vědět?
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Vyvětli mi jak se mám bránit.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Vysvětli mi jak provádět výpady.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Řekni mi něco o jezdeckých soubojích.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|Myslím, že už znám vše co potřebuji.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Dobrá otázka. První věc, kterou musíš jako bojovník znát, je jak se bránit. Vyhnout se zranění je to nejdůležitější a mnohem důležitější, než umět dobře rány rozdávat. Každý může kolem sebe mávat mečem a doufat, že někoho zraní, ale jen ti, kteří jsou dobří v obraně přežijí, aby mohli o svých soubojích vyprávět.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Za prvé, obrana je nejjednodušší pokud se sebou máš štít. Stačí se jím pouze zakrýt. [Podrž pravé tlačítko myši pro obranu štítem.] Takto budeš {chráněn/chráněna} proti všem útoku zpředu, ale stále budeš {zranitelný/zranitelná} proti výpadům ze strana a do zad.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|A co když se sebou žádný štít nemám?
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Pak musíš použít svou zbraň k obraně. To je trochu náročnější, než krýt se štítem. Zbraní se můžeš bránit útoku pouze z jednoho směru. To znamená proti švihu shora, ze stran nebo proti bodnutí. Proto musíš svého soupeře pozorně sledovat a reagovat včas na jeho útok. Tak se ubráníš proti jeho výpadu. Pokud však budeš příliš spěchat a bránit se dřív než zaútočí, může si soupeř jednoduše zvolit jiný směr útoku, proti kterému budeš v tu chvíli {bezbranný/bezbranná}.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Dobrá otázka. Nakonec se říká, že útok je nejlepší obranou. Mnoho bojovníků se staví do útočného postavení a pak jen čeká na vhodnou příležitost k výpadu. [Svou zbraň můžeš připravit k útoku podržením levého tlačítka.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|To zní dobře.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|To ano, ale má to i své nevýhody. Soupeř uvidí tvůj postoj a bude připraven se bránit tvému výpadu. V tom případě musíš svůj postoj co nejrychleji změnit a zaútočit odjinud. [Svůj postoj můžeš rychle přerušit stisknutím pravého tlačítka.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|Takže, když se nepřítel brání pro útoku ve směru v jakém ho vedu, musím ho rychle přerušit a zaútočit z jiné strany.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Přesně, výběr směrů útoku je jednou ze základních schopností dobrého bojovníka. Jsou zde čtyři hlavní směry útoku, které můžeš použít: pravý švih, levý švih, horní švih a bodnutí. Musíš každý z nich dobře využít. [Pro určení směrů útoku v základním nastavení pohni myší ve směru, z jakého chceš zaútočit, ve chvíli kdy stiskneš levé tlačítko.]
dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Velmi dobrá otázka. Kůň může být tvou nejlepší zbraní. Dává ti rychlost, výšku, sílu a iniciativu. mnoho smrtících zbraní se při použití na koni stává ještě smrtícími. Musíš si však dávat velký pozor na nepřátelské jezdce s kopím, protože tě mohou zabít v jediném okamžiku. [Pro použití kopí v sedle si vezmi kopí, nebo podobnou zbraň a bez stisknutí tlačítka pro útok, nebo obranu naber dostatečnou rychlost. Až dosáhneš nezbytné rychlosti, povolíš své kopí dopředu. Pak musíš trefit svého soupeře vedením svého koně.]

; dlga_start:close_window.210|What do you want?
; dlga_start:close_window.211|Go away.
; dlga_start:close_window.212|Heard it's cold up north.
; dlga_start:close_window.213|Gonna be pissing ice water when we reach the Wall.
; dlga_start:close_window.214|Plenty of game in these woods, if you know where to look.
; dlga_start:close_window.215|Never been north before.

; dlga_iron_bank_noho_introduce_2:iron_bank_noho_master_talk|Me and my colleagues serve the keyholders and the councillors who in turn serve the Iron Bank of Braavos, in which you now stand.
; dlga_iron_bank_noho_master_talk:iron_bank_noho_master_customize|Can you tell me more about the bank?
; dlga_iron_bank_noho_master_customize:iron_bank_noho_master_customize1|The Iron Bank was founded by twenty three citizens, sixteen men and seven women, each of whom owned a key to the bank's great subterranean vaults.
; dlga_iron_bank_noho_master_customize1:iron_bank_noho_master_customize2|Their descendants, now numbering more than one thousand, are known as 'keyholders' and proudly display their keys on formal occasions, though these keys are entirely ceremonial. Certain of these founding families have declined, with some losing their wealth entirely, yet all of them they cling to their keys and the honors that go along with them.
; dlga_iron_bank_noho_master_customize2:iron_bank_noho_master_talk|Though all the Free Cities have their own banks, the Iron Bank is richer and more powerful than all the others combined. Part of this is due to our dealings with the westerosi, but the most instrumental part is the one often repeated by my fellow citizens: The Iron Bank will have its due.
; dlga_iron_bank_noho_master_talk:close_window|Thank you.
; dlga_start:close_window.225|I'm afraid I'm on my way out.

; dlga_joy_hill_introduce_1:joy_hill_introduce_2|Hello my lady, might I have the pleasure of knowing whom you are?
; dlga_joy_hill_introduce_2:joy_hill_master_talk|I'm Joy Hill, the natural born daughter of Gerion Lannister. Uncle Tywin allows me to live here in Casterly Rock.
; dlga_joy_hill_master_talk:joy_hill_master_customize|Can you tell me more about Tywin Lannister?
; dlga_joy_hill_master_customize:joy_hill_master_customize1|He's the Lord Paramount of the Westerlands and the Hand of the King. In his youth, he destroyed the rebellious houses of Reyne and Tarbeck. I'm sure you've heard the song that singer made, The Rains of Castamere.
; dlga_joy_hill_master_customize1:joy_hill_master_customize2|Aunt Genna says she saw him smile that day. I would have liked to see that. Most people are afraid of uncle Tywin, but he's always been kind to me, especially after father disappeared. He once brought me an emerald that belonged to Princess Rhaenyra, the Targaryen princess who was the mother of Aegon Dragonbane.
; dlga_joy_hill_master_customize2:joy_hill_master_talk|Aunt Genna has told me that he's looking for a trueborn heir for me to marry... I'd be content just living here for the rest of my life, I miss cousin Jaime and cousin Tyrion, they where always nice to me.
; dlga_joy_hill_master_talk:close_window|I'm sure you'll marry a very nice man, my lady.
; dlga_start:close_window.226|Don't let me bother you. Aunt Genna says I have to be less conspicuous.
; dlga_start:creylen_introduce_1|Yes?
; dlga_creylen_introduce_1:creylen_introduce_2|Greetings. May I know who you are?
; dlga_creylen_introduce_2:creylen_master_talk|I am Maester Creylen, a servant of house Lannister.
; dlga_creylen_master_talk:creylen_master_customize|Can you tell me about Casterly Rock?
; dlga_creylen_master_customize:creylen_master_talk|According to legend, Casterly Rock was built by the Casterlys. During the Age of Heroes, Lann the Clever tricked them out of their castle, and claimed it for his own. It was the seat of the Kings of the Rock until the conquest, and remained the seat of the Wardens of the West. During the Blackfyre Rebellion, lord Leo Lefford was slain by Quentyn Ball outside the gates of Lannisport, who then proceeded to besiege the Rock. When the Grey Lion came out to challenge him, he was forced back inside, but Quentyn Ball was unable to take the castle.
; dlga_creylen_master_talk:close_window|Goodbye.

; dlga_benedict_broom_introduce_2:benedict_broom_master_talk|I am Ser Benedict Broom, the master-at-arms of Casterly Rock.
; dlga_benedict_broom_master_talk:benedict_broom_master_customize|Can you tell me about the Westerlands?
; dlga_benedict_broom_master_customize:benedict_broom_master_talk|I guess. The Westerlands is one of the regions of the Seven Kingdoms, ruled by house Lannister. It borders the Reach, the Riverlands and the Crownlands. While a fairly small region, compared to the North and the Reach, it is home of the richest gold and silver mines in Westeros, making the Westerlands the undisputedly richest region of the Seven Kingdoms.
; dlga_benedict_broom_master_talk:close_window|Thank you for your time.
; dlga_start:close_window.228|I'm afraid I have to get going. I have to drill the squires.

; dlga_whitesmile_wat_introduce_2:whitesmile_wat_master_talk|I guess I am! I'm the only singer at court, at least!
; dlga_whitesmile_wat_master_talk:whitesmile_wat_master_customize|Can you sing me a song?

; dlga_rolph_spicer_introduce_2:rolph_spicer_master_talk|Indeed I am. Ser Rolph Spicer, and don't you forget it.
; dlga_rolph_spicer_master_talk:rolph_spicer_master_customize|Can you tell me the history of house Westerling?
; dlga_rolph_spicer_master_customize:rolph_spicer_master_talk|I suppose. The Westerlings are an ancient house, they can trace their ancestry to the Age of Heroes, and Maegor Targaryen, the one they named 'the Cruel', married a Westerling. However, truth be told, the Westerlings are not as prominent as they once where.
; dlga_rolph_spicer_master_talk:close_window|Thank you for your time.

; dlga_rufus_leek_master_talk:rufus_leek_master_customize|Can you tell me about Duskendale?
; dlga_rufus_leek_master_customize:rufus_leek_master_customize1|It used to be ruled by house Darklyn, an ancient house that traced its lineage to the Age of Heroes, during which they had been petty kings. Under the Targaryen kings, the town served as one of the trading stops for ships going to the Vale and Braavos. The reign of the Darklyns ended with the Defiance though...
; dlga_rufus_leek_master_customize1:rufus_leek_master_customize2|Lord Denys had married a seductress from the Free Cities. It is said that she filled her husbands ear with the poison that eventually led to his rebellion against the Targaryens, over something as foolish as a new town charter. When the Mad King came to handle the affair himself, Lord Denys imprisoned him in the Dun Fort.
; dlga_rufus_leek_master_customize2:rufus_leek_master_customize3|Lord Tywin, then Hand of the King to Aerys, descended upon the town with a mighty host, but lord Denys threatened to hang the king if lord Tywin tried to storm the walls. In the end, Barristan the Bold managed to sneak into the town and bring out the king, killing Ser Symon Hollard in the process.
; dlga_rufus_leek_master_customize3:rufus_leek_master_customize4|With his hostage gone, lord Denys opened his gates and begged for forgiveness. It did him no good. He, and his entire family, was executed. The lady Serala, who was said to have been the cause of the misery, was burned alive, but not before she had her tongue and female parts torn out with hot pincers, the very parts which with she was said to have enslaved her husband.
; dlga_rufus_leek_master_customize4:rufus_leek_master_talk|What a horrifying tale!

; dlga_genna_lannister_master_customize:genna_lannister_master_customize1|Hmph! A flatterer, are you? Well, nevermind, I suppose flattery serves it purpose, if you're too cowardly to tell the truth.
; dlga_genna_lannister_master_customize1:genna_lannister_master_customize2|But surely always telling the truth is the mark of a fool, when the person one is adressing is the younger sister of Tywin Lannister.

; dlga_marwyn_master_customize:marwyn_master_customize1|Of course I can. But remember, the term magic is broad, and it has a different meaning to many people. Ignorant peasants may call a lords ability to handle sword and lance magic, and many is the town whore who has sworn she saw a dragon crossing the sky, when all she saw was a falling star.
; dlga_marwyn_master_customize1:marwyn_master_customize2|However, magic is a real force in this world, though it grows weaker... Or should I say, it grew weaker. I'm no longer so sure. Something stirs in the east. There has been signs, portents...
; dlga_marwyn_master_customize2:marwyn_master_talk|But you wanted to know about magic. I'd advice you to read Archmaester Pellandons book 'Magic and Mysteries'.

; dlga_myles_master_customize1:myles_master_customize2|Dorne is bordered by the Sea of Dorne to the north, the islands known as the Stepstones to the east, and the Summer Sea to the south. Stretched between them is the mountain range known as the Red Mountains, which separates Dorne from the remainder of the Seven Kingdoms by land.
; dlga_myles_master_customize2:myles_master_talk|Dorne is the hottest region in Westeros. The region is rocky, mountainous, arid and dry, and features the only desert on the continent. Its rivers provide some fertile lands and even during a long summer there is enough rain and other supplies of water to keep Dorne habitable. Inland water is almost as valuable as gold, and wells are jealously guarded.

; dlga_vyman_master_customize:vyman_master_customize1|I guess. The land is named for the many rivers that flow across the plains. The largest of them, the Trident, is rivaled only by the Mander and the Rhoyne.
; dlga_vyman_master_customize1:vyman_master_customize2|The Riverlands is not considered one of the traditional Seven Kingdoms, as they where ruled by the ironborn before the Conquest.

; dlga_colemon_master_customize:colemon_master_customize1|I suppose. The Vale is where the Andals initially landed. As such the Arryns are one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility in the Seven Kingdoms and ruled as Kings of Mountain and Vale for centuries until they bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror when the young king wanted to ride a dragon.
; dlga_colemon_master_customize1:colemon_master_customize2|When the Mad King demanded that Jon Arryn give up his wards, Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, he instead raised his banners in revolt.

; dlga_wendamyr_master_talk:wendamyr_master_customize|Can you tell me about the Iron Islands?
; dlga_wendamyr_master_customize:wendamyr_master_customize1|I suppose. The Iron Islands consists of seven major islands, Pyke, Great Wyk, Old Wyk, Harlaw, Saltcliffe, Blacktyde and Orkmont. Before the Conquest, the ironborn held sway wherever the sound of waves where heard, and ruled the Riverlands. When Balerion the Black Dread burned Harren and all his sons in the tower of Kingspyre, King Aegon offered the ironborn to choose amongst themselves who would hold supremacy over them. They choose Vickon Greyjoy and his line.
; dlga_wendamyr_master_customize1:wendamyr_master_customize2|The men of the Iron Islands have ever felt the strain of being unable to return to the Old Ways, and various Greyjoys have rebelled over the years. Before Balons rebellion, the last rebellion was led by Dagon Greyjoy, who prevailed against the lords Stark and Lannister, but was unable to defeat the Targaryens..
; dlga_wendamyr_master_customize2:wendamyr_master_talk|Opposed to the rest of Westeros, the Andals did not convert the First Men of the Isles to the Faith of the Seven, but rather saw themselves converted. The ironborn worship the Drowned God, who wages eternal war agains the Storm God. It is said the Drowned God made the ironborn to reave and rape, to carve out kingdoms for themselves and to make their names known in fire, blood and song.

; dlga_old_nan_master_talk:old_nan_master_customize|Can you tell me about the Night's King?
; dlga_old_nan_master_customize:old_nan_master_customize1|In the Age of Heroes, the Night's Watch choose their thirteenth Lord Commander. He was a fearless warrior, bold and brave. Once, when walking the Wall, he saw a beautiful woman on the other side. Her skin was pale as snow, and her eyes burned with a blue glow. Lesser men would have felt fear, but he was without such, and he met her at the edge of the woods, and there they made love, though her skin was cold as ice. When he gave his seed to her, he also gave her his soul.
; dlga_old_nan_master_customize1:old_nan_master_customize2|After their union, he brought her back to the Nightfort, and there he declared himself king, and her his queen, and he ruled the Nightfort as his own castle for thirteen years. Using vile sorcery, he bound the men of the Night's Watch to his will, and made them do his bidding. During those dark years, horrible atrocities where commited. In the end, the King in the North and Joramun, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined their forces and brought down the Night's King, freeing the men of the Night's Watch from his hold on them. 
; dlga_old_nan_master_customize2:old_nan_master_talk|When the two kings searched the Nightfort, they found that the Night's King had been sacrificing to the Others. The kings never spoke of what they saw, but it was decreed that the name of the Night's King may never be spoken again by living man. There are many tales about who the Night's King was. Some say a Bolton, other mentions the Umbers. Don't you believe them. The man who became the Night's King was born here in Winterfell, the younger brother of the same King in the North who killed him.

; dlga_bartimus_master_talk:bartimus_master_customize|Can you tell me about the Wolf's Den?
; dlga_bartimus_master_customize:bartimus_master_customize1|Yes, gladly! King Jon Stark raised the Wolf's Den to defend the mouth of the White Knife from raiders from the sea. It was the seat of younger sons, brothers, uncles and cousins to the King in the North. Some passed the castle to their sons and grandsons, and cadet branches of House Stark have ruled the Wolf's Den. The Greystarks lasted for five hundred years, until they rose in rebellion against Winterfell.
; dlga_bartimus_master_customize1:bartimus_master_customize2|After the Greystarks, the castle switched many hands. House Flint held it for century, and House Locke for almost two. Slates, Longs, Holts and Ashwoods held the Wolf's Den, charged by Winterfell to keep the river safe. Reavers from the Three Sisters took the castle once, and made it their toehold in the north. During the wars between the North and the Vale, it was besieged by Osgood Arryn, the Old Falcon, and burned by his son, the one they called 'the Talon'. The Wolf's Den was captured by slavers from the Stepstones when Edrick Stark had grown too feeble to defend his realm. Then a long, cruel winter came that froze the White Knife. When the slavers were huddled around their fires, Edrick's great-grandson, the king they called 'Ice Eyes', took back the Wolf's Den. He stripped the slavers naked and gave them to the slaves chained up in the dungeon. They, amongst them my own ancestors, hung the slavers' entrails in the branches of the heart tree as an offering to the Old Gods.
; dlga_bartimus_master_customize2:bartimus_master_talk|A thousand years before the conquest, the Manderlys took oaths before the old gods and the new to be the Starks of Winterfell's men forever in return for protection from their enemies and the land around the Wolf's Den that became White Harbor.

; dlga_green_man_1_master_customize2:green_man_1_master_talk2|Do the Old Gods truly observe the world through the faces in the weirwoods?
; dlga_green_man_1_master_talk2:close_window|That is not for me to say. Lately though, I have felt like someone was watching me. And many of my brothers have had strange dreams, of a wolf with ravens wings, flying high above the world...
; dlga_start:close_window.306|I have to get going.
; dlga_start:guardsman_alyn_introduce_1|Careful with this one, he's stark raving mad.
; dlga_guardsman_alyn_introduce_1:guardsman_alyn_introduce_2|Who is he?
; dlga_guardsman_alyn_introduce_2:close_window|Fuck if I know. Came stumbling out of the woods, raving about flesh and blood.
; dlga_start:close_window.307|Watch your face, he likes to bite.

; dlga_start:stoneman_introduce_1|Greetings, my friend.
; dlga_stoneman_introduce_1:stoneman_introduce_2|What is this place?
; dlga_stoneman_introduce_2:stoneman_master_talk|This is the Sorrows.
; dlga_stoneman_master_talk:stoneman_master_customize|Can you tell me about this place? It seems strange.
; dlga_stoneman_master_customize:stoneman_master_customize1|Chroyane, nicknamed the festival city, was once the richest and most splendid of the cities along the Rhoyne. Its streets were said to be made of water and its houses of gold.
; dlga_stoneman_master_customize1:stoneman_master_customize2|According to legend, the men of Volantis and Valyria hung Prince Garin in a golden cage after defeating the Rhoynar. Garin allegedly called upon Mother Rhoyne to destroy the invaders with a curse; that night the river's waters rose to destroy the volantenes and valyrians. The spirits of the drowned lords of fire are said to remain beneath the water, however, and their cold breath rises to become fog.
; dlga_stoneman_master_customize2:stoneman_master_talk|Chroyane is now known as the Sorrows. Mists rule the area and people infected with greyscale roam the ruins.
; dlga_stoneman_master_talk:close_window|What are you doing here, then?
; dlga_start:close_window.311|I would keep my distance if I where you.
; dlga_start:sajius_introduce_1|Greetings, my friend.
; dlga_sajius_introduce_1:sajius_introduce_2|What is this place?
; dlga_sajius_introduce_2:sajius_master_talk|This is one of the many ruins left over from the Valyrian Freehold.
; dlga_sajius_master_talk:sajius_master_customize|What happened here?
; dlga_sajius_master_customize:sajius_master_customize1|When the Doom came to Valyria, great rents opened in the earth, swallowing palaces, temples, entire towns. Lakes boiled or turned to acid, mountains burst, fiery mountains spewed forth molten rock a thousand feet into the air.
; dlga_sajius_master_customize1:sajius_master_customize2|Red clouds rained down dragonglass and the black blood of demons, and to the north the ground splintered and collapsed and fell in on itself and an angry sea came rushing in.
; dlga_sajius_master_customize2:sajius_master_talk3|The proudest city in all the world was gone in an instant, its fabled empire vanished in a day, the Lands of the Long Summer scorched and drowned and blighted. If you want to know more, go talk to my wife Comaelle.
; dlga_sajius_master_talk3:close_window|Goodbye
; dlga_start:close_window.312|Do not drink the water from these pools.
; dlga_start:comaelle_introduce_1|Greetings.
; dlga_comaelle_introduce_1:comaelle_introduce_2|Are you Commaelle?
; dlga_comaelle_introduce_2:comaelle_master_talk|Yes, I am. Would you like to hear a story?
; dlga_comaelle_master_talk:comaelle_master_customize|I would.
; dlga_comaelle_master_customize:comaelle_master_customize1|Once there was a young boy, born with a golden navel. His mother didn't know how he came to have such a navel. No one in his village knew either.
; dlga_comaelle_master_customize1:comaelle_master_customize2|The boy grew up, and left the village. He travelled the world, seeking an answer for his golden navel. He sought out shadowbinders in Asshai, warlocks in Qarth, and sorcerers in Valyria. But none knew the reason for his golden navel.
; dlga_comaelle_master_customize2:comaelle_master_talk3|Finally, he came upon a hermit, living in a tree. The hermit turned the boys navel around, ten times. Then he turned it another ten.
; dlga_comaelle_master_talk3:close_window|Then the boys ass fell off.
; dlga_start:close_window.313|Go away, huahaha!
; dlga_start:old_crone_introduce_1|Leave me be!
; dlga_old_crone_introduce_1:old_crone_introduce_2|What are you doing here, old woman?

; dlga_start:peddler_maester_introduce_1|Yes?
; dlga_peddler_maester_introduce_1:peddler_maester_introduce_2|What are you doing here?
; dlga_peddler_maester_introduce_2:peddler_maester_master_talk|Our wagon broke down amidst the ruins, and our guardsmen seem unable to put on a new wheel.
; dlga_peddler_maester_master_talk:peddler_maester_master_customize|Can you tell me about this place?
; dlga_peddler_maester_master_customize:peddler_maester_master_customize1|Certainly. The original name of Oldstones has been lost in the mists of time, and the current name was given to the ruins by the smallfolk. Before the Andals invaded, when the Riverlands where ruled by House Mudd, this place was their seat.
; dlga_peddler_maester_master_customize1:peddler_maester_master_customize2|Tristifer Mudd, the one they called the Hammer of Justice, ruled from here, and his grave is over there, by the sepulchre.
; dlga_peddler_maester_master_customize2:close_window|Fascinating.

dlga_start:beowulf_starter_introduce_1|Co chceš?
; dlga_beowulf_starter_introduce_1:beowulf_starter_introduce_2|I'm just visiting. Who are you?
; dlga_beowulf_starter_introduce_2:close_window|I am Criston, a maester of the citadel. You look like one who does not care about higher learning, however. If you come back later, I'm sure that singer who arrived a few weeks ago can entertain you.
; dlga_start:close_window.319|What?
; dlga_start:beowulf_talk|Greetings, {my lord/my lady}. I am Samol, the wandering singer. I have played at the court of Sunspear, and in the Ragman's Harbor, at the Temple of Memory and in the brothels of Flea Bottom. Across the Smoking Sea, in far away Qarth and Leng, people have heard my voice, and fair maidens have gone to their sleep thinking of me.
; dlga_beowulf_talk:beowulf_talk2|Continue, please.
; dlga_beowulf_talk:close_window|I have other things to do than to listen to a singer. Farewell.
; dlga_beowulf_talk2:beowulf_talk3|Oh, there is little more to tell. Every singer wanders far, and boasts of the places he has seen, the people he's met. Singers the world have plenty of, but heroes? Now that's a different matter entirely. Imagine, if you will, a great hero, on a daring quest.
; dlga_beowulf_talk3:beowulf_talk4|What quest?
; dlga_beowulf_talk3:close_window|Excuse me, I have important matters that require my attention.
; dlga_beowulf_talk4:beowulf_talk5|I have a treasure with me, a war mace. It was given to me for services rendered, but I do not have any use for it. It's called Coldbringer. I will give Coldbringer to you, if you go on a quest to retrieve two items for me. A book and a horn.
; dlga_beowulf_talk5:beowulf_talk6|A war mace? Hmph, sure. Will any horn and book do or do you need something special?
; dlga_beowulf_talk5:close_window|I have better things to do than to chase after some horn and glittery jewelry. Farewell.
; dlga_beowulf_talk6:beowulf_talk7|Oh, it has to be a very special horn and book. Not just a book, a grimoire. I am old, but you can make the journey I cannot. You must meet an old hermit, Rodgar. I believe he has made his home in the Wolfswood, to the north of Winterfell. He knows where the horn is. Be wary though, I've heard that he's gone quite mad.
; dlga_beowulf_talk7:close_window|Very well, I'll seek out this Rodgar.
; dlga_beowulf_talk7:close_window.1|I am not interested.
; dlga_start:close_window.320|Yes?
; dlga_start:pj_beowulf_talk|I see the shadows coming! In the north, a blind raven with a thousand eyes, and one! Ohhh, how he torments me! I see him through my trees! He knows me, and I fear him! But he cannot reach me here, the runes protect me! They're strong, strong, strong in the north.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk:close_window|Are you mad?
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk:pj_beowulf_talk2|Are you Rodgar?
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk2:pj_beowulf_talk3|I am Rodgar, Rodgar, Rodgar! Maybe I'm a tree, or a raven! Sometimes, I'm an elk! Heh heh! Who are you? Do you serve the mistress of light? I feel her flames! I feel them through the trees! Those cruel flames! Ohhh, I want my cold brothers! Don't fret now, they're coming! Coming soon! They'll quench all the flames, hah! He's as dark as night, the thirteenth night!
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk3:pj_beowulf_talk5|My name is {playername}. Samol sent me. He told me you have a special horn, and he wants it for himself.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk5:pj_beowulf_talk6|Hah! Yes, take the horn. No wait! It's mine! Away with you!
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk6:pj_beowulf_talk8|Give me the horn!
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk8:close_window|I don't have it! It was taken from me! By the son of the bloody lady! She bathes in blood, even in her death! I see her through the tree. Beneath it, she cuts the maidens throat, and she drinks the blood. Oh, the blood is so pure! Her bats are great, great bats they are! She sits in the castle of the king, the burned castle. It's so massive! Massive castle, massive castle, huge castle! She laughs at me when she sees me! Her eyes! They're terrible! They're so cold!
dlga_start:pj_beowulf_talk.1|Co chceš?
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk:pj_beowulf_talk2.1|What happened to the Lothstons?
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk2:pj_beowulf_talk3.1|Oh, their House went extinct years ago. Rose in rebellion against Aegon the Unlikely. Fools, the lot of them, and cruel fools at that. Or mad, one might say. Lady Danelle... that one was more than mad.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk3:pj_beowulf_talk5.1|When they where buried, did the servants put anything in the graves?
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk5:pj_beowulf_talk6.1|I don't know. They might have. Come to think of it, I did see a lordling digging around the graveyard a couple days ago. Might be he found something. If you ask me, the dead should be left alone, but it's not my place to question nobles. I don't remember his name, but he had twin towers on his surcoat. What's the name of that house now? House Crey? Something like that.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk6:close_window|I know this sigil well. The Freys of the Crossing. You have been most helpful.

; dlga_morcant_creditos:close_window.12|I'm Ben, the blacksmith. People call me Ben Blackthumb. Been here since the Lothstons I have. I dare say, even the Brave Companions are not as bad as Mad Danelle. I know that she's mostly used for frightening children, but I tell you, some of the things we saw in those days...
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk:close_window.1|No matter, I'm leaving.
; dlga_start:pj_beowulf_talk.2|What do you want, huh?
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk:pj_beowulf_talk2.2|Have you ever been to Harrenhal?
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk2:pj_beowulf_talk3.2|Yes... what is it to you? You want the book? Take it! I've been plagued by nightmares ever since I dug it out the ground! I thought it was valuable, and it might be! But the pictures in it... and the nightmares... shadows moving across a forest... attacking a hill... there's a huge bear, long dead, eyes blue and cold...
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk3:pj_beowulf_talk4|Give me the book AND the horn.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk3:close_window|I can't carry that right now..
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk4:pj_beowulf_talk5|I don't have the horn anymore! It never even left Harrenhal! That goat took it from me! Him and his bloody mummers, pah! They didn't have the right! I was there under a banner of peace, to ransom my cousin!
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk5:pj_beowulf_talk6.2|Yes, it's all very sad. Where can I find this... goat?
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk5:pj_beowulf_talk7|Tell me where the horn is. Now!
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk6:close_window.1|I imagine he's still at Harrenhal. He's' not actually a goat, you know. Just some sellsword from Qohor. His name is Vargo Hoat.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk7:close_window|I yield! I yield! It must still be with Vargo Hoat at Harrenhal! Unless the castles been taken by someone else! I don't think he'd survive long as a captive of the Starks!

; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk2:pj_beowulf_talk3.4|Yes, I do. I've been waiting for you, {playername}. You want the horn? Sure you do. But you can't have it. The horn is evil. Very evil. There's a darkness to it, a terrible darkness. Let me keep it, and I'll pray for you. The Lord of Light will surely grant you great favors!
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk3:pj_beowulf_talk4.1|No... I already gave my word, and I want the horn. Now.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk3:close_window.1|I can't carry it right now.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk4:pj_beowulf_talk5.1|Well, I am no warrior to fight you for it. But I have my tricks, and I'm handy with a dagger. Very handy. If you truly want the horn, all you have to do is solve a small riddle. The Lord of Light will favor me, and blind your mind to the true answer. If you fail, the horn shall never belong to you. I've coated the inside with wildfire, and a single shake will make the horn catch fire.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk5:pj_beowulf_talk6.3|Hear my riddle! When my first is a task to a young lady of spirit, and my second confines her to finish the piece, how hard is her fate! But how great is her merit, if by taking me whole she effects her release!
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk6:pj_beowulf_talk7|Childbirth.

; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk8:close_window.1|Oh, that is wrong, the Lord of Light truly favors his servants. Your quest ends here.
; dlga_pj_beowulf_talk:close_window.4|I forgot.
; dlga_start:pj_samol_talk|Yes, {playername}?
; dlga_pj_samol_talk:beowulf_espada|I have the horn and the book.

; dlga_start:wildfire_starter_introduce_1.10|Yes, can I help you?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_1:wildfire_starter_introduce_2.12|Who's in charge here?
; dlga_wildfire_starter_introduce_2:close_window.11|That would be Elder Brother, but I'm afraid he's not here right now. He went to Fairmarket to enlist the help of valiant men to right the wrongs done to us.
; dlga_start:close_window.321|Excuse me, I'm very busy.

; dlga_wildfire_talk2:wildfire_talk3.36|A company of our brothers recently returned from a journey to the Starry Sept at Oldtown. Amongst the things they brought north was a relic of Baelor the Blessed himself! A ring, said to have been worn by the king when he went to Dorne, to rescue the Dragonknight from the pit of snakes! But on the road, not far from Raventree Hall, they where attacked by Aegon Bloodborn, the outlaw son of Ser Aenys Frey. I thought he'd died years ago, but brother Toman swore it was him. He stole all of the brothers supplies and goods, and the ring besides! Find him, {playername}, and bring him to justice! There's been reports of outlaws close to The High Fall, might be you'd find him there.
; dlga_wildfire_talk3:wildfire_talk4.30|I'll bring you his head!
; dlga_wildfire_talk4:close_window|He might also have sought refuge with his sire at The Crossing. With war spreading across the land, one outlaw hiding at his grandfathers castle could easily go unnoticed.

; dlga_start:pj_wildfire_talk.27|What are you here for?

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.28|Hah! When I'm done with you, not even the prayers of the High Septon will save you! Do you truly believe you can harm me here, in my lord grandfathers casle?
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk3:pj_wildfire_talk5.12|No, but you will have to leave eventually. When you do, you die.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk5:close_window.8|Maybe it'll be you choking on your own blood!
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:close_window.27|Hmph!
; dlga_start:order2.4|I'll hang you from a tree!

; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk:pj_wildfire_talk2.28|Yes! It was quite difficult.
; dlga_pj_wildfire_talk2:pj_wildfire_talk3.29|Really? Well done {playername}! I have a gift for you, a book. The Seven-Pointed Star, the holy book of our faith. Treasure it, to show your devotion to the Seven!

; dlga_start_craftsman_soon:close_window|Good day, my {lord/lady}. We hope to begin production in about {reg4} days
; dlga_start:master_craftsman_talk|Good day, my {lord/lady}. We are honored that you have chosen to visit us. What do you require?
; dlga_master_craftsman_pretalk:master_craftsman_talk|Very good, my {lord/lady}. Do you require anything else?
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_accounts|Let's go over the accounts.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk|Let's check the inventories.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.1|I'd like you to sell goods as they are produced.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.2|I'd like you to keep all goods in the warehouse until I arrive.
; dlga_master_craftsman_accounts:master_craftsman_pretalk|We currently produce {s3} worth {reg1} coins each week, while the quantity of {s4} needed to manufacture it costs {reg2}, and labor and upkeep are {reg3}.{s9} This means that we theoretically make a {s12} of {reg0} coins a week, assuming that we have no raw materials in the inventories, and that we sell directly to the market.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_production_options|Could you explain my options related to production?
; dlga_master_craftsman_production_options:master_craftsman_production_options_2|Certainly, my {lord/lady}. Most of the time, the most profitable thing for you to do would be to let us buy raw materials and sell the finished goods directly to the market. Because of our longstanding relations with the local merchants, we can usually get a very good price.
; dlga_master_craftsman_production_options_2:master_craftsman_pretalk|However, if you find that you can acquire raw materials cheaper outside {s5}, you may place them in the inventories, and we will use them instead of buying from the market. Likewise, if you feel that you can get a better price for the finished goods elsewhere, then you may ask us to deposit what we produce in our warehouses for you to take.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_auction_price|It will no longer be possible for me to continue operating this enterprise.
; dlga_master_craftsman_auction_price:master_craftsman_auction_decide|A pity, my {lord/lady}. If we sell the land and the equipment, and liquidate the inventories, I estimate that we can get {reg4} coins.
; dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_liquidation|That sounds reasonable. Please proceed with the sale.
; dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_pretalk|Hmm. Let's hold off on that.

; dlga_start:mayor_begin.1|Good day, {playername}.
; dlga_mayor_begin:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed|{playername}, it was an incredible feat to get {s14} and {s15} make peace, and you made it happen. Your involvement has not only saved our town from disaster, but it has also saved thousands of lives, and put an end to all the grief this bitter war has caused. As the townspeople of {s19}, know that we'll be good on our word, and we are ready to pay the {reg12} coins we promised.
; dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay|Thank you. Let me have the money.
; dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay|No need for a payment. I only did what was right.
; dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay:close_window|Oh, yes, of course. We had already got the money for you. Here, please accept these {reg12} coins together with our most sincere thanks. Me and the people of our town will not forget your help.
; dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay:close_window|You are indeed an extraordenary person, and it is an honour for me to have known you. You not only did what was impossible and put an end to this terrible war, but you won't even accept a reward for it. Very well, I will not insist on the matter, but please know that you will have our eternal respect and gratitude.
; dlga_mayor_begin:lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed|Very nice work, {playername}, you made short work of those lawless curs. Thank you kindly for all your help, and please accept this bounty of 150 coins.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed:close_window|It was my pleasure, {s65}.
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_looters_quest_response|Ah, {playername}. Have you any progress to report?
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed|I've killed some looters.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods|I've brought you some goods.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:close_window|Not yet, sir. Farewell.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2|Aye, my scouts saw the whole thing. That should make anyone else think twice before turning outlaw! The bounty is 70 coins for every band, so that makes {reg1} in total. Here is your money, as promised.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:close_window|And that's not the only good news! Thanks to you, the looters have ceased to be a threat. We've not had a single attack reported for some time now. If there are any of them left, they've either run off or gone deep into hiding. That's good for business, and what's good for business is good for the town! I think that concludes our arrangement, {playername}. Please accept this silver as a token of my gratitude. Thank you, and farewell.

; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Hah, I knew I could count on you! Just tell me which item to take from your baggage, and I'll send some men to collect it. I still need {reg1} coins worth of goods.

; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:close_window|Well done, {playername}, that's the last of the goods I need. Here is the money for your {s6}, and a small bonus for helping me out. I'm afraid I won't be paying for any more goods, nor bounties on looters, but you're welcome to keep hunting the bastards if any remain. Thank you for your help, I won't forget it.
; dlga_mayor_begin:close_window|Good to see you again {playername}. I have heard that you have delivered the cattle successfully. I will tell the merchants how reliable you are. And here is your pay, {reg8} coins.
; dlga_mayor_begin:move_cattle_herd_failed|I heard that you have lost the cattle herd on your way to {s9}. I had a very difficult time explaining your failure to the owner of that herd, {Ser/my lady}. Do you have anything to say?
; dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2|I am sorry. But I was attacked on the way.
; dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2.1|I am sorry. The stupid animals wandered off during the night.
; dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed_2:merchant_ask_for_debts|Well, it was your responsibility to deliver that herd safely, no matter what. You should know that the owner of the herd demanded to be compensated for his loss, and I had to pay him 1000 coins. So you now owe me that money.
; dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.1|{playername} -- I am in your debt for bringing back my friend's daughter.  Please take these {reg8} coins that I promised you.  My friend wished he could give more but paying that ransom brought him to his knees.
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those thieves the punishment they deserved. Here is your reward, {reg5} coins. I would like to give more but wine and food doesn't come cheap these days. Hard luck, eh? 
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.1|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those nasty sellswords the punishment they deserved.  I hope they weren't too much trouble, petty outlaws and criminals are nothing to you, I'd imagine. Here is your reward, {reg5} coins. I would like to give more but alas, with all this turmoil and strife... Well, you know...
; dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.2|I heard you dealt with our little problem, {playername}. I can see you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh? You might consider taking it up full time. Well, here's your reward.
; dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.3|Oh, it's you. Enlighten me, how exactly does one lose a simple fight to some poxy, lowborn barflies? Truly, if I ever want to take a lesson in how to lay down and die, I'll be sure to come to you. Get out of my sight, {playername}, I have things to do.
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.2|Well -- it sounds like you were able to track down the bandits, and show them what happens to those who would disrupt the flow of commerce. Here is your reward: {reg5} coins. It is well earned, and we are most grateful.
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.3|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those bandits the punishment they deserved. You are really as good as they say. Here is your reward: {reg5} coins. I would like to give more but those bandits almost brought me to bankruptcy.
; dlga_mayor_begin:merchant_ask_for_debts|According to my accounts, you owe the merchants guild {reg1} coins. I'd better collect that now.
; dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_paid|Alright. I'll pay my debt to you.
; dlga_merchant_debts_paid:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I'll let my fellow merchants know that you are clear of any debts.
; dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_not_paid|I'm afraid I can't pay that sum now.
; dlga_merchant_debts_not_paid:close_window|In that case, I am afraid, I can't deal with you. Guild rules... Come back when you can pay the {reg1} coins. And know that we'll be charging an interest to your debt. So the sooner you pay it, the better.

; dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_about_job|About the job you gave me...
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_political_talk|I have some questions of a political nature.
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_economy_report_1|How is trade around here?
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_wealth_comparison_1|How does the wealth of this region compare with the rest of the world?
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_investment_possible|I wish to buy land in this town for a productive enterprise
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk|You already operate a {s4} here. There probably aren't enough skilled tradesmen to start a second enterprise.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.1|{s9}
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.1|Of course, {s0}. You are the lord of this town, and no one is going to stop you.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment|Well... Given your relationship with our liege, {s4}, I think that you will not find many here who are brave enough to sell you any land.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.2|Well... To be honest, I think that we in the guild would like to know you a little better. We can be very particular about outsiders coming in here and buying land.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.2|Very good, {s0}. We in the guild know and trust you, and I think I could find someone to sell you the land you need.
; dlga_mayor_investment_advice:investment_choose_enterprise|A couple of things to keep in mind -- skilled laborers are always at a premium, so I doubt that you will be able to open up more than one enterprise here. In order to make a profit for yourself, you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply, but for which the raw materials are cheap. What sort of enterprise would you like to start?
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary|A mill and bakery, to make bread from grain
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.1|A brewery, to make ale from grain
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.2|A tannery, to make leather from hides
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.3|A wine press, to make wine from grapes
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.4|An oil press, to make oil from olives
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.5|An ironworks, to make tools from iron
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.6|A weavery and dyeworks, to make velvet from silk and dye
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.7|A weavery, to make wool cloth from wool
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.8|A weavery, to make linen from flax
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:mayor_pretalk|Zapomeň na to.
; dlga_investment_summary:mayor_investment_confirm|Very good, sir. The land and the materials on which you may build your {s3} will cost you {reg7} coins. Right now, your {s3} will produce {s4} worth {reg1} coins each week, while the {s6} needed to manufacture that batch will be {reg2} and labor and upkeep will be {reg3}.{s9} I should guess that your profit would be {reg0} coins a week. This assumes of course that prices remain constant -- which, I can virtually guarantee you, they will not. Do you wish to proceed?
; dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_investment_purchase|Yes. Here is money for the land.
; dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_investment_advice|No -- that's not economical for me at the moment.
; dlga_mayor_investment_purchase:mayor_pretalk|Very good. Your enterprise should be up and running in about a week. When next you come, and thereafter, you should speak to your {s4} about its operations.
; dlga_mayor_talk:close_window|[Leave]
; dlga_mayor_info_begin:mayor_info_talk|I am the guildmaster of {s9}. You can say I am the leader of the good people of {s9}. I can help you find a job if you are looking for some honest work.
; dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_info_lord|Who rules this town?
; dlga_mayor_info_lord:mayor_info_talk|Our town's lord and protector is {s10}. {reg0?She:He} owns the castle and sometimes resides there, and collects taxes from the town. However we regulate ourselves in most of the matters that concern ourselves. As the town's guildmaster I have the authority to decide those things.
; dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thanks.
; dlga_mayor_political_talk:mayor_political_questions|Politics? Good heaven, the guild has nothing to do with politics. We are loyal servants of {s10}. We merely govern our own affairs, and pass on the townspeople's concerns to our lords and masters, and maybe warn them from time to time against evil advice. Anyway, what did you wish to ask?
; dlga_mayor_prepolitics:mayor_political_questions|Did I mention that we here are all {s9}? Because I can't stress that enough... Anyway... Is there anything else?
; dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_war_description_1|What is the cause of all these wars?
; dlga_mayor_war_description_1:mayor_war_description_2|Well, to answer your question generally, each of the western monarchs claims to be the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, with the exception of the Stark boy who just wants to rule the North and the Trident.. Some of these claims are based on forgotten dynastic marriages and others are based on obscure promises, while Myr, Volantis, Lys and Tyrosh have been fighting over the Disputed Lands since the doom of Valyria, and Braavos has a long standing enmity towards the former valyrian cities. So in theory, any one realm has the right to declare war on any other realm at any time.
; dlga_mayor_war_description_2:mayor_war_description_3|In practice, to make war is exhausting work. It is easy enough to lay waste to the enemy's farmland, but crops will grow back, and it is a far different matter to capture an enemy stronghold and to hold it. So the monarchs and archons will fight a little, sign a truce, fight a little more, and so on and so forth. Often, a monarch will go to war when another realm provokes them. At such times, some bad influences who look to enrich themselves with ransoms and pillage will clamor for retribution, and thus the damage caused by war to a monarch's treasury is less than the damage caused by doing nothing would be to his authority... I'm of course not talking about {s10}, as no one would ever question {reg4?her:his} authority
; dlga_mayor_war_description_3:mayor_war_description_4|I would stress again that we in the guild have nothing to do with politics. But if {s10} were to ask for my advice on these matters, as a loyal subject, I would tell {reg4?her:him} that while {reg4?her:his} claim is truly just, even the most legitimate claim must be backed by armed men, and armed men want money, and money comes from trade, and war ruins trade, so sometimes the best way to push a claim is not to push it, if you know what I mean...
; dlga_mayor_war_description_4:mayor_prepolitics|You may tell {s10} this if you see {reg4?her:him}. Don't mention my name specifically -- just say 'the people of {s4}' told you this. Our personal opinion, of course, as to what would be in {s10}'s best interests. None of us would ever dream of questioning a monarch's sovereign right to push {reg4?her:his} legitimate claims.
; dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_politics_assess|What is {s10}'s policy in regards to the other realms of this world?
; dlga_mayor_politics_assess:mayor_politics_assess_realm|Which realm did you have in mind?
; dlga_mayor_politics_assess_realm:mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment|{s11}
; dlga_mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment:mayor_prepolitics|{s14}
; dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_internal_politics|What can you say about the internal politics of the realms?
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics:mayor_internal_politics_2|Well, here in the {s4} we are all united by our love for {s5} and support for {reg4?her:his} legitimate claim. But I have heard some talk of internal bickering in other realms...
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_2:mayor_internal_politics_3|The lords of a realm often have very different ideas about honor, strategy, and the way a nobleman should behave. In addition, they compete with each other for the ruler's favor, and are constantly weighing up their position -- how they stand, how their friends and family stand, and how their enemies stand.
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_3:mayor_internal_politics_4|Underlying all the tensions is the possibility that a lord may abandon his liege, and pledge vassalhood to another. In theory, each lord has sworn an oath of vassalage, but in practice, a vassal can always find an excuse to absolve himself. The vassal may claim that the liege has failed to hold up his end of the bargain, to protect the vassal and treat him justly. Or, the vassal may claim that his liege is in fact a usurper, and another has a better claim to the kingship.
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_4:mayor_internal_politics_5|Lieges and vassals still watch each other carefully. If a king believes that his vassal is going to change sides or rebel, he may indict the vassal for treason and seize his properties. Likewise, if a vassal fears that he will be indicted, he may rebel. Usually, whoever makes the first move will be able to control the vassal's fortresses.
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_5:mayor_prepolitics|Now, men do not trust a vassal who turns coat easily, nor do they trust a king who lightly throws around charges of treason. Those two factors can keep a realm together. But if relations between a vassal and a liege deteriorate far enough, things can become very tense indeed... In other lands, of course. These things could never happen here in the {s4}.
; dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_pretalk|That is all. Thank you.
; dlga_merchant_quest_about_job:merchant_quest_about_job_2|What about it?
; dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_what_if_fail|What if I can't finish it?
; dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_about_job_working|Well, I'm still working on it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_working:mayor_pretalk|Good. I'm sure you will handle it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_last_offered_job:merchant_quest_brief|Eh, you want to reconsider that. Good...
; dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk|I hope you don't fail. In that case, I'll have to ask for the price of the cargo you were carrying.
; dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk.1|Well, just do your best to finish it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I am counting on you then. Good luck.
; dlga_merchant_quest_stall:mayor_pretalk|Well, the job will be available for a few more days I guess. Tell me if you decide to take it.

; dlga_mayor_economy_report_2:mayor_economy_report_3|{s42}
; dlga_mayor_economy_report_3:mayor_pretalk|{s47}
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief|Well, you look able enough. I think I might have something you could do.
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_looters_choice|We've had some fighting near the {s5} lately, with all the chaos that comes with it, and that's led some of our less upstanding locals to try and make their fortune out of looting the shops and farms during the confusion. A lot of valuable goods were taken. I need somebody to teach those bastards a lesson. Sound like your kind of work?
; dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_looters_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
; dlga_merchant_quest_looters_brief:close_window|Excellent! You'll find the looters roaming around the countryside, probably trying to rob more good people. Kill or capture the bastards, I don't care what you do with them. I'll pay you a bounty of 40 coins on every band of looters you destroy, until all the looters are dealt with.
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_explain_2|Well, there is a very great favor which you could do us... As you may have heard, some {s10}s have come across the border to attack our people. {s5} is under great pressure from some of the more bellicose of {reg0?her:his} vassals to respond with a declaration of war. Unfortunately, while the great lords of this land grow rich from bloodshed, we of the commons will be caught in the middle, and will suffer.
; dlga_merchant_quest_explain_2:merchant_quest_brief|We are not saying that {s5} should overlook this aggression -- far from it! But if {reg0?she:he} charges one of {reg0?her:his} own lords to respond, then the cycle of provocation will necessarily lead to a full-fledged confrontation. Now, if an outsider were to step in and defeat a {s10} lord in battle, then honor would be done, and it would defuse the clamor for war. If the defeated lord were a known troublemaker -- {s7} -- then the {s10}s might be able to overlook it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm|We need you to attack and defeat {s7}. This will not be an easy task, and that outsider would damage {his/her} relationship with the {s10}s, but we would be very grateful. We could not acknowledge a connection with that outsider, but we could be sure that {he/she} would be handsomely rewarded... Could you do this?
; dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief|Aye, I can do it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_pretalk|I would prefer not to get mixed up in such things
; dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice|The raiders are likely to have laid up their ships in a well-concealed cove, somewhere along the coastline, preferably next to a small stream where they have some water.

; dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.1|Bandits such as these usually establish their hideouts in the foothills on the edge of the desert, often in a canyon near a spring.

; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1|This war between {s15} and {s14} has brought our town to the verge of ruin. Our caravans get raided before they can reach their destination. Our merchants are afraid to leave the safety of the town walls. And as if those aren't enough, the taxes to maintain the war take away the last bits of our savings. If peace does not come soon, we can not hold on for much longer.
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1:merchant_quest_brief|You are right. But who can stop this madness called war?
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject|It is your duty to help the nobles in their war effort. You shouldn't complain about it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject:close_window|Hah. The nobles fight their wars for their greed and their dreams of glory. And it is poor honest folk like us who have to bear the real burden. But you obviously don't want to hear about that.
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3|There have been attempts to reconcile the two sides and reach a settlement. However, there are powerful lords on both sides whose interests lie in continuing the war. {reg0?They:These men} urge all others not to heed to the word of sensible men, but to keep fighting. While these leaders remain influential, no peace settlement can be reached.

; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6|What can be done about this?
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6.1|Alas, it seems nothing can be done about it.
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7|There is a way to resolve the issue. A particularly determined person can perhaps persuade one or both of these lords to accept making peace. And even if that fails, it can be possible to see that these lords are defeated by force and taken prisoner. If they are captive, they will lose their influence and they can no longer oppose a settlement... What do you think? Can you do it?
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8|It seems difficult. But I will try.

; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9|Most of the merchants in the town will gladly open up their purses to support such a plan. I think we can collect {reg12} coins between ourselves. We will be happy to reward you with that sum, if you can work this out. Convince {s12} and {s13} to accept a peace settlement, and if either of them proves too stubborn, make sure he falls captive and can not be ransomed until a peace deal is settled.
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10|All right. I will do my best.
; dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_no|Sorry. I can not do this.

; dlga_village_elder_request_mission_ask:village_elder_tell_mission|A task?
; dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission|{My good sir/My good lady}, our village has been going through such hardships lately. The harvest has been bad, and recently some merciless bandits took away our seed grain that we had reserved for the planting season. If we cannot find some grain soon, we will not be able to plant our fields and then we will have nothing to eat for the coming year. If you can help us, we would be indebted to you forever.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2|Hmmm. How much grain do you need?
; dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_reject|I can't be bothered with this. Ask help from someone else.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_3|I think {reg5} packs of grain will let us start the planting. Hopefully, we can find charitable people to help us with the rest.

; dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:elder_hunt_smugglers|There is something you may be able to help us with, {playername}. To add to all our other troubles, recently the village has become home to a nest of smugglers, who are normally based out of {s3}. They drink and carouse, not to mention being engaged in the nefarious practice of smuggling. I am afraid a passing lord will happen upon them, and exact terrible retribution on our poor village. Can you help us with this problem?
; dlga_elder_hunt_smugglers:elder_hunt_smugglers_accepted|I will deal with them. Where are they?
; dlga_elder_hunt_smugglers:elder_hunt_smugglers_rejected|I fear I cannot accept such a mission at the moment.
; dlga_elder_hunt_smugglers_accepted:close_window|Oh, that is good news, {playername}.  I'll send a boy to tell them that a raiding party has been seen on the horizon, and it appears to be making for {s4}. That should flush them out, and no doubt they will head directly for {s3}. It will then be up to you to hunt them down. Good luck.

; dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:elder_quest_scholar|My {lord/lady}! You must help! They're eating all our food! Wait, arh, let me explain. Several days ago, a party of noblemen arrived in the village. They were on their way to {s8}, when they were attacked by bandits. Their escort fled, and the noblemen themselves barely made it here.
; dlga_elder_quest_scholar:escort_scholars_quest_brief|And now we can't get rid of them! They refuse to leave without an escort and they're chubby fellows, my {lord/lady}. They eat, and eat, and eat. If we don't get rid of them soon, we'll all be in grave danger come winter. If you can take them to {s8}, we will be eternally grateful. But please, don't lose them along the way, for sure as a pig is a pig, they'll be back here like a shot.
; dlga_escort_scholars_quest_brief:scholar_quest_taken|I will escort the nobles.

; dlga_arena_training_melee_intro_reward:arena_training_melee_intro_2|There is, actually. Some of the wealthy townsmen offer prizes for those fighters who show great skill in the fights.

War is sure to engulf the Seven Kingdoms, now that the Hand has been executed, and the people will be nothing more than war fodder. Poverty feeds on the weak, and the strong men abuse the sword and the lance to impose their power and control over the humble ones.

; dlga_member_give_order_invite_feast_verify_2:member_give_order_invite_feast|Yes. It is time for us to strengthen the bonds that bring us together.
; dlga_member_give_order_invite_feast_verify_2:member_pretalk|On second thought, this is perhaps not the time.
; dlga_member_give_order_invite_feast:member_pretalk|All right then. I shall dispatch messengers informing the lords of the realm of your feast at {s4}.
; dlga_member_direct_campaign_call_to_arms_verify:member_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2|You wish to summon all lords for a new campaign?

; dlga_member_give_order_call_to_arms:member_pretalk|All right then. I will send messengers and tell everyone to come here.

; dlga_member_give_order_disband_army_2:member_give_order_disband_army|Yes. We no longer need all our forces here.

Here in {s5}, we produce less than {reg4} towns, and produce more than {reg5}. Production is of course affected by the supply of raw materials, as well as by the overall prosperity of the town.

Here in {s5}, the villages produce less than the hinterland around {reg4} towns, and produce more than {reg5}. The wealth of a town's hinterland, of course, is heavily dependent on the tides of war.
